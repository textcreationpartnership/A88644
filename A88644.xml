            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is a Famous Sentence of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> Christian Reader, That the Law of GOD was given, as an Instruction for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Grace; and Grace was given for the Fulfilling of the Law, which without the help of Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Fulfill'd; which does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any Defect in the Law, but in our Corrupt Nature; and that Defect is to be Discover'd by the Law, and Repair'd by Grace. These are Words worthy such an Author; they are an Abridgment of almost all the Sense of Christian Philosophy; which Teaches us the Nature and Quality of the Law of God; as also the Virtue, and absolute Necessity there is of Grace, and the Methods of Obtaining it, among which Prayer is not any of the least. Therefore, having in the former
<pb facs="tcp:154273:4"/> Volume prescrib'd Rules, and given In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for Living Well, which is what appertains to the Law; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, we now Treat of Prayer, by which Grace is obtain'd; and by it the Power of Living Well; as will more plainly appear in the following Chapter. Now tho' it properly belong to the Sacraments to confer this Grace, yet having already spoken of them in the Second and Third Treatises of this Memorial, there remains not any thing to say of them in this place. And because there are Two Sorts of Prayer, whereof one is only made by the Heart, and is call'd Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer; and the other, which adds the Exterior Words of the Mouth to the Inward Sentiments of the Heart; we shall speak of the Latter in this First Treatise, and of the Former in the Second; that every one may understand how he is to Govern Himself in the one as well as the other.</p>

               <p n="1">1. TWO things are Requisite,<note place="margin">Knowledge and Power requisite to live well. How these are obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law and Grace.</note> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader, towards a Good Life. One of them is Knowledge, the other Power. That is to know what must be done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Live Well, and to be able to Perform it. The One (as we have said) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the Law, and the other to the Grace of the Gospel; for the Law gives us the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil, but the Gospel gives us
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154273:5"/> Grace to do Good and avoid Evil. So that the Law furnishes us with Knowledge, and Grace with Power. The Law Enlightens the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but Grace moves the Will. The Law shews us the way to Heaven, but Grace gives us Strength to walk in it. The first is like the Body, the latter like the Soul, which Animates the Body. The former, God gave us by the Hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> but the latter, by his only Son; as S. <hi>John</hi> says, <hi>The Law was given</hi> Moses,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note>
                  <hi>but Grace and Truth was made by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>1.</hi> Why Vertue being Natural to Man, he meets with such Difficulty in the Practice of it.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. OF these Two Parts (so requisite for a Good Life) the latter is more Necessary and more Excellent than the former, in as high a Degree as the Soul excels the Body, and the Gospel the Law. The reason is, because Man is not so subject to Sin for want of knowing Good from Evil (the Light of Nature being in some measure sufficient to make this Distinction) as through the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Appetite, which shuns Good, and embraces Evil; adhering to what it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, and rejecting what it Praises. Thus he fulfils the saying of the Apostle, <hi>I do not that Good which I will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.19.</note>
                     <hi>but I act that Evil which I will not.</hi> The Cause of this is the Sweetness Man thinks there is in Vice, and the Bitterness he finds in Vertue; wherefore Pleased with the one, and Disgusted at the other, he follows that he fancies Sweet, and slights what he conceits Bitter, tho' the latter be the most Wholesom and Profitable.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154273:5"/> Hence it is, with just cause, we say, that for the Attaining of Vertue Man has more need of Power than Knowledge; for every one is Sensible and Understands what is Good, but every one does not Aim at it, because of the Difficulty he meets in the pursuit of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus it appears, that Man is like a Sick Person, who loaths all Diet that is for his Health, and covets only that which is Prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to his Distemper: For if such a one had Meat put before him, and were Entreated to Eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Life lay at stake; he could not but think it was really so, yet would he not Eat, not for want of knowing how much it concerned him, but because he could not prevail with his Stomach nauseating that Food. To this miserable Estate was Man reduced by Sin, for he knows his Life and Salvation depends on keeping GOD's Commandments, and yet says, he cannot Endure that Diet. He is Convinced, That the Life of his Soul is to be maintain'd by Charity, Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Humility, Patience, Temperance, and other Vertues; but he hates them, and loves their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites, that is, Incontinency, Vanity, Luxury, with all other Vices and Sensual Pleasures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet it may be asked, Why Vertue should be Difficult, since Natural to Man? For Man is a Rational Creature, and Vertue is Agreeable to Reason; then why should that be Difficult to a Rational Creature, which is Agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. It is not Difficult to a Horse to Run, nor to a Fish to Swim, but rather Delightful to them, because those Actions suit with the Nature of those Creatures. Then if it be Suitable to the Nature of a Rational Creature to live according to the Rules of Reason, (that is Vertuously)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154273:6"/> why should Vertue be Irksom to him? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, That if Human Nature were in that goodly Disposition as when Created by GOD, then the Exercise of Virtue would not be Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but rather Pleasing to it, but having thro' Sin fallen from that happy Estate, and being Sick, 'tis no wonder it cannot Perform that, being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed, which it could when in perfect Health. We daily see a Man that is Healthy can Run, Leap, go Up or Down, and do what he pleases without much Pain, yet when Sick he can do none of these things, but with great Trouble. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it not strange, that Vertue should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Man in the Condition he is in; which in his Perfect State would have been Easie and Delightful to him, as Suitable to his Nature; for as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says, <q>To a depraved Appetite that Meat is Loathsom, which would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to one in Health; and the Light, which is recreates the Eyes that are Strong and Well, is Offensive to those that are Weak.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus it appears, That all the Curses Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD laid upon our First Parents, when they Sinned, reached them Spiritually, as well as Temporally. For he said to the Woman, That from that time forward, she should bring forth her Children in Sorrow, whereas before she knew not what Sorrow was. Now this is as well to be understood of the Spiritual bringing forth of Good Works, as of Children, for if Man had not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he would have performed all Good Works without the least Trouble, but rather with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which now he does not, because Sin Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Nature, rendred all Vertuous Actions Difficult. God also said to the Man; In the Sweat of thy Brow thou shalt Eat thy Bread;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154273:6"/> which as well as the rest, is verify'd in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sense; for we see how much Sweat and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it costs, to act Virtuously (which is the true Food of the Soul) whereas, but for Sin, it had been Pleasant and Delightful. Nor does the Curse laid on the Earth affect us less. God said to it, it should produce Briars and Brambles. Who is there that does not conceive how agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this is to our miserable Flesh? What Earth is there that produces so many Briars, as it does? And if thou wilt know what Briars these are, hear St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.19.</note>
                     <hi>But the Works of the Flesh are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, which are Fornication, Uncleanness, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, Luxury, the serving of Idols, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Enmity, Strife, Contention, Anger, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Division, Envy, Homicide, Drunkenness, Revelling, and the like.</hi> All which the Apostle calls Works of the Flesh, because the Root of them all is in our Flesh corrupted by Sin. These are therefore the true Briars it produces, and this the greatest Curse it drew on it self by Sin. This is the Fruit our Flesh reaps of what it sowed; and if it would gather any other, it must be brought forth by Dint of Labour, and with the Sweat of our Brow.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So that as the Earth we go upon, unless ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd, produces Briars and Brambles, and other useless Weeds; but if it be expected to produce Useful and Beneficial Plants, it must cost the Countryman Labour and Industry, in Digging, Sowing, and looking after his Ground; even so the Earth of our Flesh of it self, and without Help bears these Thorns of Vices, and Inordinate Appetites; but if it be required to produce Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Fruits of Virtue, it is requisite that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Industry be applied, and that Helps be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154273:7"/> sought from Heaven and Earth. This is the Cause why there is such Difficulty in attaining to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, besides the Force of an Ill Habit, which some have contracted, whereby depraved Nature is strengthned, and deeper rooted in.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. YOU will ask, If this be so, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is there to overcome so great a Difficulty? This Question the Apostle proposes; and he himself answers it. After having largely, in the 7th Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> declared the Malice and Obstinacy of our Flesh, at last he cries out, <hi>Unhappy I, who will deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi> That is, from this Flesh, subject to the Death of Sin. He himself answers, <hi>The Grace of God, which is given us through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> For this our Lord came into the World, to Repair Nature, to Heal our Wounds, and to be our Repairer, our Saviour, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and our Assistance, that what we lost through the Sin of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> we might recover thro' the Grace of the Second; for as the First by his Pride and Disobedience destroyed Nature, so the Latter by his Humility and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience restored it. This is done by Means of the Grace conferred on Man, thro' the Merits of his Passion. For this Grace it is that reforms Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, restores our Souls to its true Form, Cloaths, Decks and Adorns in the Sight of God, Cures our Diseases with Virtues and Habits it produces, Heals our Wounds, Enlightens our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154273:7"/> Inflames the Wills, Strengthens our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Lulls asleep our Passions, Quells our Evil Inclinations, Bridles our Appetites, Restores the liking of Spiritual Things, causes a Loathing of the Sensual, and thus makes the Yoke of the Law of God easie to us. For as from the Being of our Soul proceed the Faculties with which it acts, so from the Being of Grace (which is, as it were, the Soul of Spiritual Life) proceed all Virtues and Gifts of the Holy Ghost; which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed and received into the Faculties of our Soul, Reform and Habituate them to all Virtuous Works, in such manner, that they, which before lay, as it were, bound and incapable of doing Good, by this Means become active and fit for all that is Virtuous. Hence it is that Divines, with good Reason, compare these Virtues and Heavenly Habits to the Grease applied to the Axle-Tree, on which the Wheels turn; for as these turn easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Axle-Tree is greased, so the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Soul move with Pleasure in all Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Works, when they are made supple with this Oyl of the Holy Ghost. True it is, this Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is greater in some than in others, according to the Measure of Divine Grace every one has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus by Means of the Virtue of Grace, the Difficulty we find, in bearing the Burden of the Law of God, is overcome, as the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> in few Words intimates, saying,<note place="margin">Isa. 10.27.</note>
                     <hi>And the Yoke shall rot in virtue of the Oyl;</hi> to signifie the Weight of the Law of God would be lightned by virtue of Grace, which is meant by this Holy Oyl. The same Prophet in another Place says, <hi>But they that hope in the Lord shall change Strength,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 40.31.</note>
                     <hi>they shall take Wings like those of the Eagle, they shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154273:8"/> run, and shall not labour; they shall walk, and shall not faint.</hi> Behold here how the Virtue of Grace strengthens, and makes Men active for the Race. By what he says, that they shall change their Strength, is easily to be understood, that those who before had the Strength of Men (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Spirit and Assistance of God) shall have new given by God, which shall so change them, that they who before were strong, to perform Evil Works, and weak for Good ones, shall on the contrary become weak to all Evil, and strong and vigorous to all that is Good.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This same God promises us by the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>Hieremy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hier. 31.32.</note> saying, <hi>That the time shall come when he will give the World a new Law, far different from the old, which shall not be writ on Tables of Stone, but in the very Entrails and Heart of Man; by Means of the Grace of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, who shall so teach and instruct them in the Law of God, that they shall be in love with it, and he will kindle in them a most Earnest and Ardent Desire of fulfilling it.</hi> What Words could more clearly express the Nature of Grace, and the Assistance we receive from it towards performing of good Works, by means of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues proceeding from it?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Of these three, particularly assist us towards this good End, <hi>viz.</hi> Charity, Devotion, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy. For among the many other Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies proper to Charity, one is, that it makes God's Yoke pleasant, and his Burden light, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> testifies in these Words, <hi>The Labours of those that love are not Painful, but rather Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, as it is with those who Hunt, Hawk, or Fish.</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> also says, <hi>In what a Man loves, there is no Pain; or if there is, the Pain it self is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:154273:8"/> The same Saint in another Place, speaking to God, says, <hi>The Service I render thee, O good Jesus, scarce lasts an Hour; and if it hold longer, Love makes me insensible of it.</hi> This is so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that (as St. <hi>Basil</hi> writes in one of his Epistles) <hi>Labour is more delightful where there is Love, than even that, which of it self is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, where there is Dislike.</hi> For this Reason it is, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> aptly compares the Love of God to the Wheels of a Cart; which when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wheels, can scarce be moved; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once put on, tho' they increase the Weight, it becomes more fit for Motion. So it is with the Love of God; which being the greatest Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Burden laid upon us, is yet such a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that it enables us to carry all others, like to the Feathers of a Bird; which tho' of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are some Weight, yet they make the Bird the more fit to fly.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Second Thing that particularly helps us is Devotion, tho' this be harder to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood than the other, by those who have not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it. For tho' a Man do not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know the Love of God, yet by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Loves he may guess at this. But how shall he, who never had Experience of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, (which is a Supernatural Virtue, and an Inward Motion of the Holy Ghost) know what it is, tho' he be never so much instructed: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we will say as much of it as can be explained by Words. You must understand then, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is a Supernatural Agility and Promptness, which the Holy Ghost immediately creates in the Soul of a devout Persons, by Means whereof he makes him active and ready for all things that appertain to the Service of God; so that he,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154273:9"/> who without Devotion was Slothful, Heavy and Uncouth, for those Exercises receives in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion (by virtue of the Holy Ghost) new Strength and Vigour to perform those Works not with a Heaviness, but Diligence; not with Distaste, but with a Gust; not with Anxiety, but Joy; not with Dislike, but cheerfully, and with a good Will. By which it appears. that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the opposite to the Vice of Sloth, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Heaviness; so that as Sloth renders Man backward and careless in the Service of God, so on the contrary, Devotion makes him active and diligent in it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Thus, as Faith is a Supernatural Virtue, which inclines our Understanding firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Matters of Faith, tho' contrary to Reason; and as Charity is another Virtue, which moves our Will to love God above all things, and to order our selves and them for him; so Devotion is a Supernatural Affection, which inclines our Will to do all things that belong to the Service of God with Alacrity and Cheerfulness.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For Example, A Traveller, who is faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Hunger, and can scarce draw his Legs after him, or move, if he comes to an Inn, and eases and rests awhile, finds himself so refreshed, as if a new Soul had taken Possession of his Body; and therefore rising, and fitting himself to walk, he calls to his Companions to go. The same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that the Corporeal Repass'd has on the Body of the Traveller, the same Devotion (which is the Spiritual Food) has on the Soul it enters into.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Look upon a Mother, who has a Child she dearly loves, sick in Bed, see how diligent she is to do all things that may conduce to his Health, tho' never so difficult. Observe how busie a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154273:9"/> Man is about those things that turn to his Profit, and by those so Obvious and Familiar Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, you may discover the Nature of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Affection, which the Holy Ghost creates in the Souls of those who are truly devout: They being mov'd by this Affection, find themselves so ready and active in all things, which they think pleasing to God, that not satisfi'd with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Burden of the Commandment, they still add more weight of Sufferings; and thinking all this too little in their enflamed Desires, often wish to shed their Blood, and yield up their Life for the Love of God.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. This (dear Brother) is Devotion in such Measure, as it is to be explain'd; it is the Food of the Inward Man, it is a Spiritual Strength and Vigour, a Heavenly Dew, a Breach of the Holy Ghost, a Light of Faith, a Flash of Charity, and a Beam of the Divine Splendor, from which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this good Affection of the Will. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, a Religious Doctor says, <q>What is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion but a Fountain of Living Water, which moistens all our Spiritual Exercises? A Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wine, that Chears the Heart of Man: A most sweet Balsam, that Heals the Wounds of our Passions: A Food of the Soul, by which it is nourished, and perseveres in Goodness: A Spiritual Tongue, which serves us to speak with God: A Heavenly Manna, in which is all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousness. And lastly, a Honycomb, not made by course and foul Creatures, but by the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bees, who suck from the Flowers of the Life of Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. By this it appears, how proper a Medicine this is against the common Disease of Humane Nature. For the Condition Man was left in by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154273:10"/> Sin, is, as we have describ'd it, like a sick Man, whose Appetite is lost and depraved. Then, as it would be a Cure in him, to recover his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and bring him to relish what was good for him, so the Cure of our Souls consists, in recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Appetite to Spiritual Things, which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion performs, being of great Virtue, to give us a Liking to all that is Good, and a Distaste of all that is Evil; for both these Effects proceed from the same Cause.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Nor is Spiritual Joy and Alacrity a less Help; for that, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says, is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Devotion, and one of the chief Fruits of the Holy Ghost, according to St. <hi>Paul. This it is that makes me run joyfully in the Way of God's Commandments;</hi> according to the Words of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ps. 118.32.</note> where he says, <hi>I ran the Way of thy Commandments, when thou didst dilate my Heart.</hi> This dilating is caus'd by Joy, as Oppression is by Sorrow. But what do I speak of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, since this Spiritual Joy and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction caus'd the Holy Martyrs not only to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them, but all the Sufferings and Torments in the World with Alacrity. So St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it in the 22th Chapter of his Soliloquies, in these Words; <hi>Thy Sweetness, O Lord, made the cruel Stones become sweet to St.</hi> Stephen. <hi>Thy Sweetness made the Gridiron pleasing to St.</hi> Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. <hi>Through thy Sweetness it was that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles went joyfully before the Council, because they had been thought worthy to suffer Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thy sake.</hi> This Sweetness had that Holy Virgin tasted, of whom we read, that she went to Prison with as much Satisfaction and Delight, as if she had been carried to a Feast. This the Prophet had tasted, when he said, <hi>How great
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154273:10"/> is the Multitude of thy Sweetness, O Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 30.20.</note>
                     <hi>which thou hast hid for them that fear thee?</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to make Trial of it in another <hi>Psalm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 33.9.</note> saying, <hi>Taste ye, and see that our Lord is sweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. This Sweetness makes us contemn all other Sweets, and vain Delights of the World; for, (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) when we have once tasted the Spiritual Delights, immediately all that is Flesh (that is, all Sensual Pleasure) loses its Taste, and as such is despised. After <hi>Isaac</hi> was born, <hi>Sarah</hi> said to <hi>Abraham, Cast out this Handmaid and her Son, for the Son of the Handmaid shall not be Heir with my Son</hi> Isaac. And tho' <hi>Abraham</hi> took this grievously, yet God approv'd of the Woman's Request, and ordered it should be fulfill'd. What then is the Meaning, that before the Birth of <hi>Isaac, Ishmael</hi> is so much wish'd for, and so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd, and after the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> he is hated and contemn'd? What is it, but that <hi>Isaac</hi> (who is Son of the Mistress, and whose Name signifies Laughter) is a Type of Spiritual Joy; and <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> the Son of the Slave (which is our Flesh) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes Carnal and Sensual Delight? Thus, before Men have Experience of the Greatness of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleasures, signified by <hi>Isaac,</hi> they value the Carnal, as knowing none greater. But when God opens their Eyes, and having recover'd the true Taste in their Souls, they once relish this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Manna,</hi> they immediately loath all the Delights of the World, and shun all Sensual Pleasures; and casting out the Son of the Slave, which is the Joy of the Flesh, there remains only <hi>Isaac,</hi> born of the free Mother, which is the Spiritual Joy and Comfort. By which it plainly appears, how useful this Joy is, both towards despising the Pleasures of the World, as also to cause us to run
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154273:11"/> nimbly in the VVay of God's Commandments.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. These are, dear Brother, the four Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal VVheels, on which the Chariot of Virtue moves. These are the Principal Means (next to the Sacraments) appointed by Divine Providence for Healing decay'd Nature, for Restoring our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Appetite, for making the VVay to Heaven plain, and the Yoke of God's Law easie.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>III.</hi> How Prayer is the Means to obtain Grace, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Devotion, and Spiritual Joy.</head>
                  <p n="20">20. BUT perhaps you will ask, To what Purpose is all that has been said, since this is a Treatise of Prayer? The Answer is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I found no other more convenient Method to express the Efficacy of this Virtue, and the Need we have of it. For if the Ground of Virtue be so difficult, (as has been declar'd above) and Grace, Charity, Devotion and Spiritual Joy, are so requisite for the overcoming of this Difficulty, (as has been said) how great must the Virtue and Efficacy of Grace be, since it is the most apt Means for obtaining of them all?</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For in the first Place, one of the most Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Means towards obtaining of Grace, is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to beg it of him, who alone can give it, since (as the Apostle says) the Lord is Rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all that call upon him.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.12.</note> Now to what other Virtue does this belong but to Prayer? For Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, besides that, it is a Meritorious VVork (as are all other Virtuous VVorks done in Charity); it is also efficacious for obtaining our Request; for as its Nature is to ask, so its proper Reward
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154273:11"/> is to obtain, as our Saviour plainly promis'd, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ask, and ye shall receive, seek,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11.9.</note>
                     <hi>and ye shall find, knock, and it shall opened unto you. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that asks shall receive, and he that seeks shall find, and to him that knocks it shall be open'd.</hi> VVhat then could be expressed more plain, or bountifully, and more for the Comfort of Man, than this? For (as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says) God will not deny his Assistance to him that asks it, since he himself stirs us up to ask for it. For it is a certain Argument, that he designs to give, who so often bids us ask. VVherefore <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Blessed be God, who hast not remov'd my Prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 65.20.</note>
                     <hi>and his Mercy from me.</hi> On which VVords St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says, <hi>Be assured that if God removes not thy Prayer from thee, neither will he remove from thee his Mercy; for he that gives thee a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ask, will also give thee what with that Spirit thou askest.</hi> The same Lord a little after, more earnestly, still exhorting us to ask, utters these VVords; <hi>But who of you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11.11.</note>
                     <hi>when he asks Bread of his Father, will he give him a Stone: Or a Fish, will he give him a Serpent instead of the Fish. If you therefore, who are evil, know how to give good things to your Children, how much more will your Father from Heaven give a good Spirit to those that ask it of him.</hi> Thus you see the Means to receive the good Spirit (which is the Holy Ghost, given through Grace) is to ask it. To conclude, this Medium is so proper, for the attaining that end, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> his Book, <hi>De Dogm. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> has these Words: <q>VVe believe none comes to Salvation, unless God calls him; and none af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being called, does what is requisite for this Salvation, unless God helps him; and none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this Assistance, unless he asks it by Prayer.</q>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:154273:12"/> VVhich this Saint said, not because he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that there are other Means to obtain the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, but to give us to understand how proper and convenient a Method this is among all others for the obtaining of it. For Grace being a Gift of God, the true VVay to obtain is to ask it, lifting up our Eyes, and saying with the Prophet, <hi>I have lifted up my Eyes unto the Mountains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 120.1.</note>
                     <hi>whence Help shall come to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Nor is Prayer less efficacious for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Charity than Grace, since Prayer is a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of what we need, and also a lifting up of our Heart to God. For we have above assign'd two Mediums for obtaining the Love of God; the one to consider the Greatness of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Benefits, since this particularly renders him amiable to us) and the other earnestly to beg of him this Virtue with hearty Desires and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Both these things, as well the considering as asking belong to Prayer; by which it appears, that since its Office is to lift up the Heart to God, and ask Mercies of him, it is the most proper and convenient Medium to obtain this Virtue, which is purchas'd by those two Means.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Moreover, if Conversation among Men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produce Love betwixt them, and Prayer is nothing but conversing with God, what can be more proper to attain the Love of God, than to converse always, or very often with him? Besides, if God himself Essencially is a Fire of Love, and Prayer is only an approaching to God, it follows, that he who draws nearest to the Fire, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive most Heat, and be most inflamed. For if our Material Fire (because so noble an Element) cannot deny its Heat to those that come near it, what will that Lord do, who is Infinitely more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154273:12"/> Noble, more Good, and more Communicative of himself? For this Reason St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says, <hi>That Man may be something, it is requisite he draw near to him, by whom he was made something.</hi> Hence it proceeds, that Man removing from him, is darken'd, and drawing near to him, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, removing from him, grows cold, and drawing near to him, is inflamed.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Besides, this Love being a Holy Affection and Motion of the Will; and the Will being a blind Faculty, which stirs not without some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Act of the Understanding, of Necessity there must precede such Considerations in the Understanding, as will stir up, and excite this Affection in the Will, which belongs to Prayer, in as much as it is a lifting up of our Heart to God, as has been said. Behold then how much this Virtue conduces towards our obtaining the Love of God.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And yet it more properly helps us to the attaining of Devotion, which is the Third Thing requir'd. For from what other Fountain springs the Vein of Devotion but from Prayer, and the Consideration of Things Divine? So says St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the 2. 2. in the Q. 82. where treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Causes of Devotion, he says, They are two, one which is without Man; and this he says in the Holy Ghost, who is the Author and Inspirer of this Heavenly Affection, and the other which is in Man; and this he says in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Consideration of Things Divine. For (as we said just before) Devotion being a Holy Affection and Motion of the Will, and the Will being a blind Faculty, which does not regularly move without some Preceding Light and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Understanding, it is requisite, that this Consideration precede for the producing this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154273:13"/> Affection of Devotion: Yet this alone is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and therefore another Exterior Cause is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which is the Holy Ghost (as we have said) who is never wanting to such as do what in them is; and therefore he concurs with those who humbly apply themselves to the Consideration of Things Divine, for the exciting in themselves of this Heavenly Affection.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And if you ask, why the Holy Doctor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes this Effect to the Holy Ghost above any other, whereas it is certain, that all Acts and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of infused Virtues do alike proceed from the same Spirit? The Answer is, that tho' this be true, yet Devotion (which is the first Act of the Virtue, called Religion) is a Thing so Universal, and so Noble, that therefore there is special Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to assign the Holy Ghost as Author of it. For Devotion does not only incline us to any one particular Virtuous Action (as other Virtues do) but generally disposes and forwards our Will to all that is Good; to wit, to all things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Service of God, and this great Advance cannot be made without the special Assistance of the Holy Ghost. This may in some Measure be understood by the following Example. Some Doctors with good Reason say, That Man cannot love God above all things, meerly by the Strength of Nature, tho' naturally he may do other good Works, yet not such as are meritorious. But to love God above all things, is like a Drag-Net, that carries all along with it; for no Body can love him in that manner, without directing all his Actions to God, and despising all things for him; which is so Noble and Great a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that none can truly have it, unless assisted by God. The same may be said of Devotion; for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154273:13"/> since it is its Nature to make Man's Will active and forward, not for this, or the other good Work, but for all that belong to the Service of God, therefore it stands in Need of the special Help and Assistance of the Holy Ghost to produce so Generous and Noble an Act. By which it plainly appears, that Devotion, tho' the Act of one only Vertue (that is Religion) is an Incensive to all other Virtues, and inclines the Will towards them.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This Fruit, that Divine Spirit often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in Prayer, (when made as it ought to be) so that the Hearts of those who pray are so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that whereas they began cold, weak, and slothful, for all good Works, after perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Hour, humbly imploring the Divine Mercy, they find such strong Alacrity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness for all good Works, and so great an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in their Disposition, that they scarce know themselves: Insomuch, that among the Works of Grace, which seem to be miraculous, this sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and great Alteration of one and the same Heart is none of the least. Yet it is not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (tho' supernatural as Miracles are); for the manner of its being done is not miraculous, but the common and natural Way, used by God upon the like Occasions.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Now from whence springs the Fourth Help required, that is Spiritual Joy, but from the same Sourceas does Devotion, that is, from Prayer? So God himself intimates in the VVords of <hi>Isaias,</hi> where he says, <hi>He will carry his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to his Holy Mountain, and rejoice them in the House of his Prayer.</hi> For (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> said) in Prayer is drank that Spiritual VVine, which rejoices the Heart of Man, which is the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154273:14"/> VVine of the Holy Ghost, that inebriates our Heart, and causes it to forget all Sensual Pleasures. True it is, that every sort of Prayer has not this Force. For (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) tho' the Prayer may be Meritorious, and obtain our Request, when it wants Actual Attention, provided it be not a wilful VVant, yet this Attention is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely requisite for the Principal End of Prayer, which is to cause Devotion and Spiritual Joy, these being the Nourishment of the Soul, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording Heavenly Delight; but for the obtaining hereof, (as has been said) it is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we have actual Attention.</p>

                  <head>§. <hi>IV.</hi> The Conclusion of all that has been said, with Examples of Saints.</head>
                  <p n="29">29. THUS you see how much Prayer avails for the obtaining of these Four Things that chiefly enable us to bear the Burden of the Law of God. Thus it appears how necessary it is for Man to continue the Exercise of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if he will be strengthned to keep the Law of God. And by this you may perceive, how apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after giving Precepts and Rules to live well in the foregoing Treatise, we now in this treat of Prayer, since the Difficulty we find in the former requires the Facility obtained by the latter. VVherefore <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, <hi>He that keepeth the Law, multiplieth Prayer.</hi> For understanding how necessary the Help of Prayer is for overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difficulty of the Law, he takes no less Care of the one than of the other. To the same Purpose, in another place, he has these VVords;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154273:14"/>
                     <hi>Be not hindred to pray always,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 18.21.</note>
                     <hi>and fear not to be justified even to Death, because the Reward of God abideth for ever.</hi> Here he joins always Praying, and always doing well, because of the Dependance the one has on the other. By which it appears, that if Prayer were barren, and not accompany'd by good VVorks, it would not be perfect Prayer, but perhaps an Illusion of the Devil. For whereas one of the greatest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations belonging to Prayer is that it so much forwards Virtue, and all good VVorks; if these be wanting, then Prayer fails of one of its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ends. Therefore,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> (as the Apostle says) <hi>Let him separate himself from all Wickedness, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is that calls upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> And let him not rest satisfied with not doing Evil, but endeavour to do all the Good he can, and then shall he have obtained perfect Prayer. To this Purpose St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in one of his Sermons says; <hi>With what Face can you presume to ask what God promised you, if you do not what he commanded you? First then hear his Words, and then demand the Performance of his Promises.</hi> And St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says, <hi>He who prays and sins, prays not to God, but disrespects God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. All we have hitherto said, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> fully comprehends in Three VVords, which are these; <hi>The Law commands, Grace fulfills, and Prayer, thro' Faith, obtains.</hi> That is, the Law of it self only commands and declares to us what we ought to do, but gives not Strength to perform it. But the Grace of the Holy Ghost gives us that Strength, by Means of the Virtuous Habits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it. And Prayer obtains this Grace, when ask'd with Faith and Assurance, as it ought to be ask'd. The same Saint explains this last
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154273:15"/> Particle more distinctly, saying, <hi>The Spirit of Grace creates Faith in us; and Faith praying, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Grace, that we may fulfil the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. These are the Principal Virtues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Prayer, that make for our Purpose. Others there are, whereof we speak in another Place, and therefore we will say no more of it here, but what <hi>Simon Cassia</hi> briefly expresses in these Words; <hi>Prayer is a Spiritual Work of the Earthly Body; the Sight of the Soul that looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God with the Eyes of Faith; the Rule of our Soul towards God, to whom it submits it self; a Voice that reaches the Ears of God; a sweet Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, resounding in the Heart; a Cessation of all other Corporal Works, when this is performed with the Senses retired, and a Forgetfulness of one's self, and all other Creatures; the Port of the wandring Spirit; a presenting of one's self before the Eternal Judge; a Self-condemnation; a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Divine Judgment; a true Mirror of the Soul; a Lamp of the Conscience; an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Light for Invisible Works; a Shade, that cools the Burnings of our Flesh; and a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation into the Hands of God, desiring nothing but what pleases him.</hi> All these things, in some measure, appertain to perfect Prayer, which (as one of the Holy <hi>Anchorites</hi> says) is then perfect, when he who prays knows not himself that he prays; for he often forgets himself, and all that is not God.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. For these and other great Advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Prayer, all Saints were so addicted to it, as we read in their Histories. What else did the Holy Fathers in the Desart generally do, even whilst they were working their Wicker Baskets, but give their Mind to Prayer? What else did the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154273:15"/> first of them (which was St. <hi>Paul</hi>) during the Seventy Years he liv'd in Solitude, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mortal Man, but bury himself Day and Night in Prayer and Contemplation? To what Purpose did the blessed St. <hi>Hilarion</hi> change his Cell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ten times, and hide himself from those that looked after him, but to employ himself perpetually (as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> writes) in Fasting, Psalms and Prayers? What other things did all the Monks, called <hi>Anchorites,</hi> but the Duty of Angels, which is to attend the Contemplation of Things Divine? What do we read in the Books of <hi>Judith, Esther, Tobias, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> but of Wonders and Prodigies obtained by Prayer? Who confirmed the Courage of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Judith,</hi> to undertake so great an Exploit, as cutting off the Head of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> but the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Prayer. Her City being brought into great Distress by the Army of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the Priests prayed, the People prayed, the Children prayed, Holy <hi>Judith</hi> in her Retirement prayed, and at the time she went out to the Enemies Camp, she order'd nothing but Prayers in the City; and being among the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> she went out every Night into the Field to pray, and at the time that she drew the Sword to behead the Tyrant, she strengthned her weak Arm with the Virtue of Prayer; and so cutting off her Enemy's Head, put an end to that Memorable Exploit.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. And if you should object, that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, especially those who dwelt in the Desarts, had more Conveniency to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to this Exercise, because they were free from all manner of Business; therefore will I lay before your Eyes one of the Men that had most Business in the World; that is our Glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154273:16"/> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who nevertheless arrived at the height of perfect Prayer and Contemplation. So that being beset with all the Business that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity toward his Neighbors could create, yet he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Prayer and Contemplation of the Monks in the Desart. To him therefore rightly may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Commendation of the wise Man, saying, <hi>He was as an Olive-Tree budding,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 50.11.</note>
                     <hi>and a Cypress-tree advancing it self on high.</hi> It is strange there should be found in one Man the Properties of two things so different in themselves, as are the tall and barren Cypress, and the low and fruitful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-Tree. But doubtless, both the one and the other suits with this Blessed Father; for as the fruitful Olive-tree, he produced Oyl of Mercy for Relief of his Neighbor, being employed in the Active Life; and as a Cypress, which runs up high, he lifted himself by Motions of Love, to the Contemplative Life. And so at once he was adorn'd with both the Beauties of the Olive and Cypress-Tree, taking from the one the Fruitfulness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lowness, and from the other the Loftiness without the Barrenness.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. It will be proper that all Men know, and particularly those who glory in the Name of Sons of this Saint, to whom the Memory of a Father's Example must be more pleasing, how continual he was in Prayer, and in how many manners he used it. Of this Saint's continual Prayer, and the several Manners of it, St. <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in the Third Part of his History, writes thus.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. <hi>Tho' all this Saint's Life was but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Prayer, nevertheless (besides the Seven Canonical Hours) he us'd many other Manners of Prayer, to the end, to excite Interior Devotion by Exterior Actions. The First of these was bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154273:16"/> himself lowly at the Altar, supposing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar a Figure of Christ, remembring what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 35.19.</note> The Prayer of him that humbleth himself shall penetrate the Clouds. <hi>And therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd his Friars to humble themselves profoundly, when they passed before the Image of the Crucifix wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch was humbled for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. <hi>The Second was, prostrating himself on the Ground at his full Length, as Christ prayed in the Garden; and thus with a penitent Heart, and as a Man wholly confounded, said, Lord God have Mercy on me a Sinner: And that of the</hi> Psalm. Because our Soul is humbled in the Dust,<note place="margin">Psal. 43.25.</note> our Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is glewed to the Earth. <hi>And exhorting his Friars to this sort of Prayer, he urged the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of those Holy Kings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 2.11.</note>
                     <hi>who adored the Infant Jesus prostrate on the Ground. Adding, that tho' they had no Sins of their own to pray for (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is no Man without Sin, as</hi> Solomon <hi>said in his Prayer) yet they ought to pray for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of their Neighbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="37">37. <hi>The Third was standing and disciplining himself with an Iron Chain, repeating that Verse of the Prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 17.36.</note> And thy Discipline hath corrected me unto the end, and thy Discipline, the same shall teach me.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. <hi>The Fourth was, Often kneeling, in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Leper in the Gospel, who kneeling before our Saviour, said,</hi> Lord, if thou wilt,<note place="margin">Luke 5.12.</note> thou canst cleanse me. <hi>In Imitation also of St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>who kneeling, prayed for his Enemies, as St.</hi> Luke <hi>writes in the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apostles.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7.60.</note>
                     <hi>And in this manner of Prayer he was often heard to lift up his Voice, and say,</hi> To thee, O Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 27.1.</note> I will cry, my God, keep not Silence. <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles keeping profound Silence, he only spoke
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154273:17"/> with his Heart, in which Posture he us'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time wrapped, and, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, and so he seemed to pierce Heaven with his Understanding; and then coming to himself, with great Joy, he wiped the Tears that flowed from his Eyes, stood up, and then knelt down again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="39">39. <hi>The Fifth was, Standing before the Altar, his Hands lifted up, and somewhat extended like a Book that is open; and thus he stood, as it were in the Presence of God, reading with much Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Devotion, and meditating on the Divine Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. <hi>The Sixth was, Standing in the Form of a Cross, as our Saviour prayed for us, when he was Crucified, with a loud Voice and Tears, and was heard for his Reverence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. <hi>The Seventh was, Sometimes standing with Hands stretched out, and lifted up directly towards Heaven, as an Arrow ascending from a Bow; and it is believed that by this manner of Prayer (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Increase of Grace) he obtained of our Lord what he asked for his Order. Sometimes praying in this manner, the Friars heard him repeat those Words of the</hi> Psalm,<note place="margin">Psal. 27.2.</note> Hear, O Lord, the Voice of my Petition, whilst I pray to thee, whilst I lift up my Hands to thy Holy Temple.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. <hi>The Eighth was, After the Canonical Hours, or after Grace. For at these times, the Holy Man, full of the Spirit of Devotion, with those Words of the</hi> Psalms <hi>he had sang, or heard read at Table, immediately retired to his Cell, or some So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Place; and having made the Sign of the Cross, opened a Book, and began to read in it with great Satisfaction, as if God spoke in that Book, and he hearkned to his Words, saying with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154273:17"/> the Prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 84.9.</note> I will hear what our Lord God will speak in me. <hi>And it was wonderful to see how he behaved himself in this Exercise; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it appeared as if he disputed with another, speaking deliberately, then listning with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one while he smiled, another he wept; now he would fix his Eyes upon one place, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently let them fall. Now, as well in this, as all his other Exercises, he used to rise from Prayer to Meditation, and from Meditation to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. And so great was the Reverence he bore to the Words of God, or Books of Holy Men, that being alone, he would bow his Head to the Book, and taking it into his Hands, would kiss it, but especially if it were the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="43">43. <hi>The Ninth was, Another most laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom this Holy Man had, which was, that when he travelled, he always Prayed privately, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; and the better to do so, he sent his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions before, or left them behind, that he might be alone, to this Purpose putting them in Mind of the Words of the Prophet</hi> Oseas, <hi>saying,</hi> I will carry her into the Wilderness, and there I will speak to her Heart. <hi>He used in this manner of Prayer, sometimes to move his Hands (as if he had driven away some Flies from before him) and often made the Sign of the Cross upon himself. His Religious believed, that by this kind of Prayer he had obtained the Understanding of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> Thus far are the Words of St. <hi>Antoninus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="44">44. These are the several Manners of Prayer; these the Exercises and Examples of this Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know not what I should first say of it, or what first to admire. I admire, when I consider, how great must the Delight be, that this blessed Father receiv'd, when he thus persever'd in these
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154273:18"/> Exercises, since Day and Night, Walking and Standing still; Eating, and after Eating, he was never weary of, nor had enough of these Divine Colloquies. I admire the great Variety I find in this Exercise of Prayer, to prevent nauseating al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with one sort of Diet, and to raise the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite by this Change to Spiritual Things. Above all, I admire the Conduct of this Couragious Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who fought as well with his Left as with his Right Hand, being continually assisting his Neighbor, and continually conversing with God, the one Exercise being no hindrance to the other. It is the Property of Angels, so to attend the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Men, as that yet they never cease Seeing, or Contemplating God; and this Angel upon Earth had so fix'd his Eyes upon God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Government of all his Order, nor his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor the Business of Preaching, hearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, disputing with Hereticks, Travelling, and all other Affairs committed to him, could hinder the Union of his blessed Spirit with God. And if it chanced that he was hinder'd for some Moment, it is to be believ'd, that (like those My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Creatures, which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw) he went from, and returned to his inward Retirement as quick as Lightning. For he was arriv'd to that pitch of Perfection, in which the two sorts of Active and Contemplative Life, make but one composed of both, in such manner, that the one is no hindrance to the other, but they rather help one another. For the Exercise of good Works made his Prayer more Efficacious, and the Devotion produced by Prayer render'd him more Ready to do Good. Besides, by the help of Prayer he was better able to manage Matters of Government, because he first consulted God; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154273:18"/> this also directed his Preaching, for it produc'd Words full of the Spirit of Devotion, and enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Divine Love.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. He therefore who desires to follow the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample of the Saints, and to improve in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Virtue, let him make use of this Exercise, for this it is that will stir him up, and help him on to all the others, since by it are obtain'd Grace, Charity, Devotion, and Spiritual Joy, which make Man ready and fit for all manner of Virtue.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Six Conditions, which are requisite, that Prayer may be Perfect.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is the common Opinion of all Doctors, that the Value and Merit of our Works consists not so much in the Substance of them, as in the manner of doing them. Whereupon one of them ingeniously says, <hi>That God does not so much reward the Verbs, as the Adverbs;</hi> that is, he does not so much regard what we do, as the Charity and Devotion with which we do it. Which tho' it be verified in all Works, yet it singularly appears in Prayer; which, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in due manner, and with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances requisite, will be of little or no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Wherefore St. <hi>James</hi> the Apostle says, <hi>Ye ask, and do not receive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 4.3.</note>
                  <hi>because ye ask not as you ought to do.</hi> And for the same Reason the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> exciting us to sing Praises to God, says, <hi>Sing ye to our God, sing ye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 46.7, 8.</note>
                  <hi>sing ye to our King, sing ye. Because God is King of all the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154273:19"/> Earth; sing ye wisely.</hi> For want of which Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, our Lord answered to the Prayer of the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> that they knew not what they asked. For this Reason St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in a Sermon says, That tho' Attention and Vigilance be requisite in all the good Works we do, yet in Prayer it is more particularly necessary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reason of this is, for that, as some Meats, tho' good in themselves, yet require cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spices in the Dressing, that they may be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable, so Prayer (which of it self is a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Virtue) requires the Assistance of other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that it may attain its ultimate Perfection. For it requires Charity, that it may be meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Confidence in God, that it may be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; some manner of Attention, that it may be Prayer; and actual Attention, that it may obtain Spiritual Joy and Devotion, as shall be shown in the next Chapter. All these Virtues are, as it were, the Models of Prayer, each of them adds to its Perfection, and therefore it requires the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them all, that it may be perfect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says in a Sermon, <hi>That Prayer which is void of Confidence in God, doth not pierce Heaven, because overmuch Fear holds it back, and hinders it not only from ascending, but from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing forward. Prayer which is lukewarm fails in the very Ascent, because it wants Heat and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to rise. Prayer that it Rash and Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ascends, but presently falls down again, because it meets Opposition, and is so far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Grace, that it incurrs an Offence. But Faithful, Humble, and Fervent Prayer, doubtless pierces Heaven, whence it will never return emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> These are the Words of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> by which it plainly appears, that Prayer stands in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154273:19"/> Need of the Assistance of other Virtues, as we proposed at first. The same we may understand from the Words of <hi>Hilarius,</hi> which are these: <hi>God despises Prayers that are Light, Faithless, Unprofitable, Anxious about Worldly Affairs. and full of vain Thoughts, and barren Earthly Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and void of goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Works.</hi> Then if Prayer be capable of all these Defects, it is requisite, it be accompanied with other Vertues to expel them, that so the Prayer may be Pure and Perfect.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of the First Condition of perfect Prayer, which is, that it be performed with Spirit and Attention.</head>
                  <p n="3">3. HAving laid the foregoing Foundation, it will be proper in this Place to treat more at large of the Principal Conditions requisite in Prayer, to render it perfect. Among them, the first is, that it be performed with Spirit and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. This is the Condition our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, when he says, <hi>That in order to pray we should retire into our Closet, and there in Private pray to our Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> Here we are directed at the time of Prayer to rid our Soul of all Worldly Thoughts and Cares; that having recollected our Spirit and Attention, we may wholly be employed in God. For whereas to pray is only to discourse with God, and treat with him of the most Important Affair, to wit, our Salvation; therefore it is plain, how great Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reverence are requisite. For if speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Worldly King about Worldly Affairs, we talk with great Respect and Circumspection, how much more is it requisite, when we discourse
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154273:20"/> with the King of Heaven about Heavenly Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? To signifie this, we read, that the two Cherubs, which <hi>Solomon</hi> placed on the Sides of the Ark of the Covenant, were stretched out, and stood upon the Tips of their Toes, with their Wings expanded, to denote how far Man's Heart ought to be lifted above all that is Terrene, when he approaches to God, in order to treat about Heavenly Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Neither must he be satisfied with this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, but must endeavour to add Spirit to the Attention, that is, a Cordial Affection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of obtaining what we ask, when it is any thing that appertains to the Service of God. To this the Apostle invites us, when he bids us, <hi>To pray at all times in Spirit.</hi> And this is called Praying in Spirit, because to pray in this manner is a special Motion and Gift of the Holy Ghost, of whom the same Apostle says, <hi>That he maketh the Saints pray with Sighs, which cannot he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</hi> Which Prayer scarce ever returns emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reason of the Dignity of the Holy Ghost, who inflames and quickens it. VVherefore the Prophet says, <hi>God heard the Desire of the Poor:</hi> And in another Place, <hi>I cried with all my Heart, hear me, O Lord.</hi> Which he said, because he well knew how Powerful this crying of the Heart was, to make the Prayer be heard; for this is the Powder that raises, and makes it reach God. In order to this says St. <hi>Gregory, So much the less does a Man cry, by how much the less he desires; and so much the more loudly does he pierce the Ears of God, by how much the more he extends his Desires towards him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This first Condition is requisite to the very Being of Prayer; for Prayer wanting all manner
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154273:20"/> of Attention, might better be called Distraction than Prayer, which <hi>Cassian</hi> expresses in these Terms: <hi>He prays little, who only prays whilst he kneels; and he prays not at all, who, tho' praying on his Knees, is wilfully distracted.</hi> To them that pray in such manner, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says, <hi>Thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not thy Prayer, and wilt thou that God hear it? Thou sayest thou art on thy Knees in the Church, 't<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es thro' the World, thy Mouth talkest with God but thy Heart perhaps thinks on Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> So that such Prayer is not of Force to obtain Graces of God, but rather is often Sinful, when Man goes to Prayer without any Reverence or Attention. For (as Cardinal <hi>Cajeton</hi> saith) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that a Man be not always obliged to pray, yet since he does pray, and to pray is only to talk with God, he is to talk with Reverence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And if purposely he omit to do so, he is not excusable from Sin, at least Venial. To which Purpose saith St. <hi>Basil,</hi> on this Account, cited by St. <hi>Thomas; That Divine Assistance is to be begged not Slothfully, or with a Distracted Heart; because he that so asketh, will not only fail of obtaining it, but will rather displease God.</hi> For which Reason, the manner of many Peoples Prayer is worthily reflected upon, who say their Devotions with so little Attention or Reverence, it looks more like as if they were getting by rote some Verses of <hi>Virgil,</hi> than discoursing with God. These Persons did they consider with whom they discourse, and about what Affairs, perhaps they would use another Tone and Manner of speaking.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:154273:21"/>6. True it is, that when this Distracttion of Heart proceeds not from the Neglect of the Party, who uses its best Endeavours, but from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptness of Nature, which is not wholly subdued by Reason, it is then not only no Sin, but rather reaps some Benefit and Merit. For Prayer (as Doctors say) reaps three Remarkable Advantages, because it is a Work Meritorious, prevailing for what we ask, and causing Devotion. Of which Advantages, only the last of necessity requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Attention, because Devotion proceeds from the actual Consideration and Understanding of Divine Things. But for the Two first Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which are to merit and obtain, good Will suffices, and the Intention with which a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pray, tho' afterwards his Heart be distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when it is without his Fault. Which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine serves for the Consolation of Humble and Devout Persons, who are usually too much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted when they perceive their Heart at such time to grow distracted, whereas this is natural to all Mankind, by reason of the Corruption of Nature. To this Purpose Sir <hi>John Chinacus</hi> says, <hi>Dismay not, if when at your Prayers the Enemy subtilly thrust himself in, or privately steal your Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you ought rather to be comforted, if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways labour to keep your Thought quiet, which of it self is so slippery; for to only the Angels is it granted to be exempted from such Thefts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yet tho' this be true, nevertheless the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man is to labour not only to fan away these importune Flies of vain Thoughts at such time as he prays, but also to endeavour so to order his Life, that he may not be much infested by them when he prays. And the Means to be used, says Venerable <hi>Bede, Is to shun as much as possible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154273:21"/> evil Works, and speaking and hearing vain Words, because all the Images and Idea's of what we Hear, See, or Speak, come afterwards, and settle themselves in our Heart, as in the proper place whence they sprang. And therefore as the Swine</hi> (saith he) <hi>naturally run to Dirt and Mire, and on the contrary Doves to the Springs of fair Water; so foul Thoughts have Recourse to a Soul foul and unchaste, and pure Thoughts to a modest and innocent Soul.</hi>

                  <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of the Second Condition of perfect Prayer, which is, that it be Humble.</head>
                  <p n="8">8. THE Second Condition required in perfect Prayer is Humility, of which <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> says; <hi>The Prayer of him that humbleth himself pierceth the Heavens, and will not rest till it come to God, and will not depart till the Highest look upon it.</hi> To this Virtue it belongs, to make him that prays know the extream Nakedness and Poverty, or rather the profound Abyss of Misery, into which Man fell thro' Sin, as also those which he since by his own Wickedness and Malice has incurred. For thro' Sin Man became miserable, like the Traveller, who descending from <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to <hi>Hieriço,</hi> fell into the Hands of Robbers, who took all he had, and gave him so many Wounds, that they left him half dead in the Road. In this Condition was Man left by Sin, despoiled of all the Goods of Grace, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the Goods of Nature, his Understanding clouded, his Inclination diseased, his free Will weak, his Memory distracted, his Imagination
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154273:22"/> restless, his Appetite rebellious, his Sences full of Curiosity, and above all, his Flesh foul, and ill inclin'd. And thus he remain'd most prompt to all Evil, and most averse to Good, very ready to his Destruction, and very backward to his Salvation. Tell me what could be expected from a tender Youth, set upon a wild Horse, with weak Reins in his Hand, and in a way, full of Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Stones. In this same Condition is a Man without Grace; for his Appetite is like a wild hard-mouth'd Horse; and Reason, which ought to rule it, is so dull and weak, the free Will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ought to curb, is so slender, and this World so full of Precipices and Rocks, as there are Snares in it to intrap him, which are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Then what greater Danger, what greater Poverty, what greater Misery than this?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To be short, such is the Condition of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Man, that he cannot of himself have one only Word, not one good Purpose, or Desire, or Thought, which may be pleasing to God, unless he be especially assisted by God. So that if he falls into Sin, he cannot rise from it, unless God lift him, and after being lifted up, he can do no Good of himself, but thro' the Means of Grace, and the Virtues proceeding from it. Nor is all this enough to carry him thro' what he has begun, but another Mercy is requisite to make him perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to the end. Behold then here how wounded and diseased Nature is, since it requires so many Salves to heal it. Wherefore (like an old House that threatens Ruin on all sides) so Nature stands in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed of all these Props and Supports to keep it standing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now don't you think that he who is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and weak on all sides, needs to cry to God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154273:22"/> with the Prophet. <hi>Save me, O Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 68.</note>
                     <hi>for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are entered even unto my Soul, and I am sunk into the Bottom of the Mire, and find not whereon to fix my Foot.</hi> And if to this be added, the Ills that every one of himself has committed, and the Damage his Soul has received by them, and also the ill Company of the World (which swarms with Vice and ill Examples) do not you think that putting this to the rest, you may say with the same Prophet, <hi>Save me, O Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 11.</note>
                     <hi>because the Saints have failed in the World, and Truth is diminished among the Sons of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. This profound Knowledge of his own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series makes Man pray with the Spirit of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for what can the Poor Man do but beg an Alms? The Weak Strength? The Naked Covering? The Guilty Pardon? The Captive Liberty? And the Sick a Cure? So that the plainer he discovers his Nakedness and Poverty, the more he is mov'd to cry out to God, and implore his Mercy. And as a poor Beggar from Morning till Night, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceases to beg, nor has no other Way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so the more Humble a Man is, and the more sensible he is of his Want and Poverty, the more incessantly he prays to God, and humbly begs of him Alms, and Mercy. But it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that Man be so fixed and grounded in this Knowledge, as well by what he reads, as by his own Experience, that he may almost see with his Eyes, and touch with his Hands, this his great Misery and Poverty.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But it is not only the Greatness of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, but also the Grandeur of God's Majesty, which ought to sink us to the lowest Abyss, when we go to speak with him, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> express'd it, saying; <hi>If it be true (as it is) that Thousands
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154273:23"/> of Angels serve God, and ten times an Hundred Thousand Thousands assist before him, with how much Fear and Reverence, and with how much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, must the little Frog creep out of the Lake, to appear before such great Majesty?</hi> With this Spirit pray'd that <hi>Publican</hi> of the Gospel, who durst not so much as lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and therefore was so well receiv'd. With this same Spirit did the Wicked and Idolatrous King <hi>Achab</hi> humble himself before God, and thro' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility obtained what was not due in Justice.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But how shall I say the Son of God pray'd with this same Spirit, when prostrate in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he prayed to his Father, expressing by that outward Posture the Submission and Humility of the Inward Man. Now if that so great Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and so Sovereign Greatness, has so annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it self, where can the Sink of all the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vice of the World place himself, or how can he humble himself?</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>III.</hi> Of the Third Condition of perfect Prayer, which is, that it be made with Faith and Confidence.</head>
                  <p n="14">14. AFter Humility most aptly follows Faith and Confidence, which is the Third Condition of Prayer; for Humility teaches us not to confide in our selves, but Faith shows we ought to confide in God. Humility undeceives us, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us where our Remedy is not, but Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceives us, declaring where it is. This Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is the Apostle St. <hi>James</hi> requires of us,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> when he bids us, <hi>To ask with Faith, and without Doubting, for that otherwise we shall not obtain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154273:23"/> what we ask.</hi> And how important this Faith is towards that end, our Lord himself declares in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> saying, <hi>Whatever you ask in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, believe it will be given you, and it shall be given.</hi> Behold then how requisite Confidence in Prayer is towards obtaining. By which you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what we hinted before, that Prayer merits by Charity, and obtains thro' Faith. So that as the Merit shall be proportionable to the Charity, in the same manner the obtaining shall be suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Confidence. Therefore saith St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Donatus, That as big as the Vessel of Faith we carry with us shall be, so much Water shall we gather from the Fountain of the Divine Mercy.</hi> Whereof, among many others, we have three Examples in the Holy Gospel. The Prince of the Synagogue had Faith, that if our Lord went to his House, and laid his Hand on his Daughter, he would heal her; so our Lord did, and so she was heal'd. But the Woman that suffer'd the Bloody Flux, went yet farther, and had Faith, that with only touching the Hem of our Saviour's Garment she should be heal'd; and as she believ'd, so it was done. The <hi>Centurion</hi> went farther yet, and believ'd, that without any of these Circumstances, only the Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Saviour was sufficient to heal his Servant; so he believ'd, and so it was done. By which it appears, that by how much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the Faith of him that prays, so much the more powerful will be his Prayer to obtain what he asks.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But perhaps you will say, how can I have this sort of Faith and Confidence, having done God so little Service? The Answer to this is, that this Confidence is not grounded on the Service
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154273:24"/> Man has done, but principally on the Services and Merits of Christ, and the Greatness of God's Goodness and Mercy. And if you ask, how great is this Goodness and Mercy, you will know it by the Immenseness of the Divine Substance; for (as the wise Man says) such as is the Greatness of God, such is his Mercy. For as he is Infinitely Great, so he is Infinitely Merciful; and as he has infinite Riches to distribute, so he has Infinite Bounty to distribute them. For otherwise, it were a great Imperfection and Defect in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Substance, if whereas it has Infinite Wealth to give, it had not an Infinite Soul and Heart to give them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And tho' all Divine Perfections be in him the same, and consequently equal, yet it cannot be deny'd, but that he is more Singular and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in the Works of Mercy. For tho' he have performed many, and those great Works, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate his other Virtues and Perfections, yet he has done much greater, to show his Goodness and Mercy. For, to show the Greatness of his Power and Wisdom, he created the World; and to show the Greatness of his Severity and Justice, he destroyed it by the Waters of the Flood; but to show the Greatness of his Mercy, he dy'd, and shed all his Blood for it. Now how much greater a Work is it for God to die, than for Man to die? And for God to suffer for the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld, than to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the World? For which reason, in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Vision, in which <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Glory of God on the Mount,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.5.</note> amidst the great Perfections and Wonders there discover'd to him, this was it He chiefly, and with a loud Voice proclaimed, saying, <hi>Merciful and Clement, Patient Lord, of much Compassion, and true. Which keepest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154273:24"/> unto Thousands, which takest away Iniquity, and wicked Facts, and Sins, and no Man of himself is Innocent before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Therefore the Church sings, <hi>Lord God, to whom it is proper to have Mercy, and to Pardon.</hi> And this it says, not because his other Virtues and Perfections are not proper to him, but because this is a Work of Goodness and Mercy, which is the thing he most delights in, and for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires most to be prais'd, and that which most discovers the Greatness of his Power, and his Glory; for to him alone belongs perfect Mercy, who is free from all Misery.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For this Cause then, dear Brother, when you go to ask Mercy and Pardon of this Lord, do not fear or dismay, believing you go to Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or press him to do any thing contrary to his Honour or Nature, but rather believe you go to furnish Matter for his Praise, and an Opportunity of doing a Glorious and Honourable Thing, and very agreeable to him. For as it is natural to the Sun to give light, to the Fire to burn, and to Snow to cool, even so, and much more natural is it, to that Infinite Goodness, to do Good to all its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Do not think neither that he is offended like Men, when they are importun'd; for Men grow weary of being ask'd, because they loose what they give; but being God does not lose what he has by giving it, therefore he cannot be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by asking it. Wherefore St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says, <hi>Deceive not your self, believing, that as you gain by receiving, so God loses by giving; for tho' your Stomach be never so thirsty, and your Throat ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so dry, yet the Spring overcomes all that thirst.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:154273:25"/>20. The Second Ground for this Confidence we have said to be the Merits of Christ, who is our Saviour, our Redeemer, our Advocate, our Mediator, our King, our Priest, and our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and there is no other Name under Heaven, by whose Tutelage and Protection we can be saved but this. For as God would have but one Sun in the World, which alone should have Light of its own, and of whom all the Stars should receive it, so he would allow but one only Sanctifier in the World, thro' whom all those that truly were so, should be sanctifi'd. This therefore is the Name, thro' which he so often in the Gospel bids us ask Graces of his Father, assuring, That whatever we shall ask by it, (that is, by his Merits and Sufferings) shall be granted us. And not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Lord himself gave us fit Words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we should ask thro' him these Graces, when he taught us the Lord's Prayer, which we may present to the Heavenly Father, telling him, we are sent by his Son, and that for a Token he put the Words into our Mouths, with which we should implore his Mercy, which he may well acknowledge as his own. So <hi>Thamar</hi> did, when her Father-in-law commanded her to be burnt for a Harlot, she sent him the Tokens that show'd of whom she had conceived; and thus, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of her Father-in-law, she was justifi'd, and deliver'd from the Sentence.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Thus then let us beg of the Eternal Father, that he will acknowledge whose those Words are, that we speak to him, and who sends us to him, that by him may be revoked the Sentence of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and thro' him we may obtain what of our selves we do not deserve.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:154273:25"/>22. This then is the living Temple of the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Altar on which all Petitions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to God are acceptable to him, as he himself testifi'd by his Prophet, saying, <hi>Their Holocausts and Sacrifices shall be acceptable to me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malach. 8.</note>
                     <hi>being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon my Altar;</hi> which is no other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, but the most Sacred Humanity of Christ. For it was for this Reason that God was so jealous, that there should be but one Altar of Sacrifice throughout the whole Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and consequently thro' the whole World, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that there was but one only supream Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, one only Supream Altar and Priest, on which and by whom all our Prayers and Sacrifices, could be acceptable to him, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And that you may the better conceive how great this Treasure is, and may know how to value it, and give Thanks to God for it, I will lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you an Example, which will serve to give you some sort of Light and Knowledge of this Treasure. It is not long since an honest Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ask some Favour of a Prince, writ a Petition, in which he set down all the Services done by his Father at several Times, and in several Places; and after having related and enlarged upon these Merits particularly, he so eagerly pressed for the Reward, as if he himself in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had done the Service. This same is our Case with God, and this is the way we must prevail with him; for in reality, all that are in the State of Grace are adoptive Sons of Christ, and he is our Father (as the Apostle <hi>Isay</hi> calls him) and our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isay 63. 1 Cor. 15.</note> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we are His Lawful Heirs, not only at Law, but by the last Will and Testament,<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> made by him at the last Supper, and confirmed not with the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154273:26"/> Blood of Kids, but with his own Blood, which he said he shed for us,<note place="margin">Joan 17.</note> and so made us Heirs of it. For this Reason we have a Right to ask with Assurance and Confidence the Reward of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, since all he suffer'd and endured in this World, and all the Troubles he underwent, were not undertaken for himself, but for us. For us he took Human Flesh, was Born, Labour'd, Fasted, Travell'd, Sweated, Suffer'd, Died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and He left us Heirs of all in his Will, because he had no Occasion of any of it himself to pay what he owed, being Innocent, nor to obtain Grace and Glory, which he had, as he was God. Then if the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> obtain'd the Blessing which was not his due, because he was cloath'd in the Garments of the first Begotten, whose Right it was, why may not we obtain the Blessing of Grace, tho' it be not due to us, if we take with us the Right of the only Begotten Son of God to whom it belongs.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. These then, beloved Brother, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Motives and Grounds of a Christian's Hope, besides the Infallibility of God's VVord, by which he has promis'd his certain Assistance and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all that shall have Recourse to him, as the whole Scripture testifies.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. The Effect of this Confidence is, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reserve we lay all our Affairs before our Lord; and when we shall have tried the Lawful Means which his Mercy grants us, and administers as Instrument of his Providence, that then we rest secure and satisfied with whatever happens; for since we refer our selves to the Goodness of God, since we appear'd before him, and presented our Petition, it is in a good Way; and there only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to confide in the Knowledge we have of his Infinite Wisdom, since we are assur'd neither his Mercy nor his Word can fail.</p>

For granting that sometimes the Ineffable Mercy of God extends so far as to hear a Sinner, who is not in the State of Grace, granting him thro' his Mercy what was not due to him in Justice, yet regularly speaking, it is a true Sentence of the Blind Man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who says,<note place="margin">Joan. 9.</note>

                  <p n="27">27. Now, tho' all good VVorks are great For<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warders of Prayer, yet there are two more parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cularly assign'd, which are, Fasting and Almsdeeds
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154273:27"/> which are, as it were, the two Wings, with which it ascends. For whereas it is the Law of God, that the same measure we meet shall be measured to us, therefore, as we use Mercy towards our Neighbours, so we become worthy of the Mercy of God. But Fasting helps Prayer in another manner. First, because it prepares the Body with Abstinence from Food, and by that Means makes it the lighter to fly up to Heaven: And secondly, because the Flesh being chastised, that it may not rebel against the Spirit, Man already, with the Assistance of God, begins to do what in him is, and therefore deserves that God should do what lies on his Part. Moreover, he who so seeks God, as to that end, to chastise his own Body, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Self-Love, seems then to seek him in earnest; and he who thus seeks him, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less find him. But because in treating of Penance, we have already, in the proper Place, spoken of these three Virtues, Fasting, Almsdeeds and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it will be needless to say more here.</p>

               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>V.</hi> Of the Fifth Condition of perfect Prayer, which is, what ought to be asked in it.</head>
                  <p n="28">28. THE Fifth Condition is peculiar to the Subject of Prayer, that is, what is to be asked in it. And if Man attentively regard the Greatness of the Lord, of whom he is to ask Graces, he will soon perceive, that of so great a Lord, and who is so desirous of our Good, great Benefits are to be asked, such as are the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Eternal; for all the rest that can be asked for this Life is nothing, since Life it self is nothing.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154273:28"/> True it is, that tho' these things of themselves be nothing, yet when they serve to Spiritual Ends, then may they be called something, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be asked with such Moderation, that all be referred to the VVill of God, who better knows what is fit for us, than we our selves. For many times, that which in our Judgment seemest profitable, in the Judgment of God (from whom nothing is hidden) may be hurtful; and in this Case he mercifully denies us, that which in Rigour he would grant us. And therefore St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> says,<note place="margin">Tract. 10. Super Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannem.</note>
                     <hi>It is a great Mercy that Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not that which he shall use to his own Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And consequently, if he ask such things, it is rather to be feared, lest God in his Anger grant him what he would refuse, if he were pleased.</hi> To this same purpose, in another place, he says, <hi>He who faithfully offers his Prayers to God for the Necessities of this Life, is mercifully heared, and mercifully not heared. Because the Physician knows better than the sick Man what is fit for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. Let us therefore ask all these Temporal Things conditionally, referring them to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Fatherly Providence of our Lord; but the others let us ask without any Condition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which let the first be, the Remission of our Sins, the second, Resolution never to commit Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, and the third, such Vertues in particular, as we stand most in need of; as Charity, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chastity, Patience, Obedience, Victory over our selves, and such like.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Among which, let us also ask of him the Grace of Asking, (which is the Virtue of Prayer) and is the Gift of God, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> declares in these Words; <hi>The more ardently holy Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154273:28"/> to God, so much the more Spirit do they receive, to ask of him that which they are given to understand is most pleasing to him; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from him they receive the Water, and from him the Thirst.</hi> Fourthly, Let him ask the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance for all the Members of the Church, and for his Parents, Kindred, Friends, such as are recommended to him, his Benefactors, and also for all the Poor, the Sick, Prisoners, Persons in Distress, for all Infidels, Hereticks, and evil Christians, and for all Men, as well living as dead, for this is a Prayer most acceptable to God; who being so great a Lover of Man (as he that created and redeem'd him) will always be pray'd to for them. He who endeavours to pray to God for others, advances his own Interest, and deserves so much the sooner to be heard when he prays for himself, by how much the more devoutly he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for others. Necessity obliges us to pray for our selves, but Charity for others. But of the two sorts of Prayer, that is more pleasing to God, which proceeds from Charity, than that which is grounded on Necessity.</p>

                  <head>§. <hi>VI.</hi> Of the Sixth Condition of perfect Prayer, which is the Patience and Perseverance that is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</head>
                  <p n="31">31. LET the last Condition be Patience and Perseverance in Prayer, that we may not dismay or desist from our Request, tho' our Lord never so long delay the granting of it. It is rather convenient to be so importunate (if so it may be termed) in this Case, that we may say
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154273:29"/> with Holy <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 13. Luke 11.</note>
                     <hi>Altho' he kill me, I will hope in him.</hi> Our Saviour in the Gospel recommends this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to us, and to this Purpose brings the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of a Friend, who at Midnight goes to ask of another Friend to borrow two Loafs for a Guest that is come to him; and whereas he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused himself, being already in Bed with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, nevertheless, because of the Importunity of him that knocked, he was forced to rise and give him all he wanted. Wherein our Lord concludes, that did we persevere knocking at the Gates of the Divine Mercy, what we obtain'd not thro' Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, should be granted thro' Importunity; of so great Force is Perseverance with him.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. This Virtue is very requisite in Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many times the Lord deferrs bestowing the Benefits we ask of him, either to try our Faith, to see whether that Delay provokes us to use unlawful Means for attaining our Desires, or to make us more sensible of our Wants, or by this Delay to excite in us a greater Fervour of Devotion, or because that is most convenient for our Good, or for other Causes he best knows. Therefore this Virtue is most necessary in Prayer, that it may secure the Fruit of it, and that Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may not snatch so great a Good from us. For there are many, who for a small time dispose themselves to pray, and are very intent on it; but whereas in other Affairs they suffer much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet they know not how to bear with the Delay of what they desire, and this makes them fall off, and not proceed farther in their Suit. For this reason it is very requisite that Man be very well informed in the manner of our Lord's proceeding who often waits to send the Relief in the utmost Danger, when all Hopes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154273:29"/> Succour was altogether lost, as it hapned to Holy <hi>Susanna,</hi> and to <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> had beset him in the Mountain, and to the City <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia,</hi> when the Army of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> besieged it. Otherwhiles Man thinks God has forgot him, that he refuses to hear, and is as it were asleep; as was represented by our Saviour's Sleep, when sailing in the small Ship with his Disciples, that great Storm arose; not that it is possible for God (as God) to sleep, but to express to us this kind of Dereliction, and Forgetfulness. Nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it goes farther, so that Man not only thinks he is forgetful, but rather that he is angry, and has forsaken him, as is plainly expressed to us in the Petition of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> whom our Saviour seemed to cast from him by the harsh Words he answer'd her, and, as is more plainly evinced by <hi>David</hi> throughout all that <hi>Psalm,</hi> which begins, <hi>Domine Deus salutis meae.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 87.</note> Where the Prophet lays before us many Dangers and Fears, and the being forsaken of God; yet nevertheless, he not only did not desist from his Prayer, but rather then redoubled it; for before he cry'd by Day, but at this time he added the Night to the Day, saying, <hi>O Lord God of my Salvation, in the Day have I cried, and in the Night before thee.</hi> Which no Mortal Man could do, were it not that the same Lord who terrifies, calls; and he that rejects, invites; and he who seems to make you fly, makes you ask; terrifying you on the one side, and giving you hopes on the other.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. To this may be added, that whereas the Virtues and Graces we oft ask of God, are of great and inestimable Value, he therefore with good Cause requires, that they be earnestly ask'd and desir'd, that so Man may afterwards know
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154273:30"/> how to Value, Prize, Acknowledge and Esteem them, returning worthy Thanks and Praises to the Giver of such Goods.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Now, since for all these Causes our Lord often deferrs, granting the Petitions of his Servants; hence it is, that they thinking he is in a manner forgetful of them, cry to him, saying, <hi>Arise,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 143.</note>
                     <hi>O Lord, why sleepest thou? Arise, forsake us not for ever.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Prophecy with this Complaint, saying, <hi>How long,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>
                     <hi>O Lord, shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? Shall I cry out to thee, suffering Violence, and thou wilt not save?</hi> Upon which Words St. <hi>Hierome</hi> writes, <hi>As the sick Man, who burns in a Fever, desires the Physician to give him Water; crying out, and saying, he burns, and dies, and perishes with Thirst, yet the wise and careful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician may well answer him, I well know the time when to give what you ask, and therefore do not now condescend to you, because such Mercy would be Cruelty, and you covet what is hurtful to you. Even so our Lord, who very well understands the Weight and Value of his Mercies, sometimes hears not him that calls upon him, the better to prove and provoke him the more to call; and thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him through his fiery Trial of Tribulation, renders him more just and pure.</hi> For this Reason the Prophet <hi>Hieremy</hi> said, <hi>He called upon Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Afflictions; for as others called upon God to deliver them from those Calamities, so this stout and invincible Champion challeng'd and call'd upon Miseries and Troubles, that through them he might remain the more purify'd and try'd.</hi> Thus far the Words of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> on the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk.</hi> The same thing that Holy Man desired for his Advantage, the same
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154273:30"/> Divine Providence disposes in delaying our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the same end.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. The Remedy against all these Delays is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, and with it a Confidence in the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy of that Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> who (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith) directs all things for the Good of his Elect; and as he knows what he is to give us, so also he knows the time to give it. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals says, <hi>The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord knowing what is fit for us, seems not to hear the Cries of him that prays, that he may do what is most convenient for the purging of Life through Penance, and to the end that the true Peace, which is not to be found in this World, may be sought after in the other.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the same Book he says, <hi>Many times, the longer our Prayer is delay'd, the more it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; and when it seems our Cries are despis'd, then our Desires are more strengthned in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of our Hearts, as it happens with Corn in the Ground; which the longer it is kept back by the Frost, the greater Harvest it afterwards yeilds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. This is a sort of Perseverance in Prayer, which requires to be continued for many Days. There is also another sort, which is necessary for continuing long in Prayer at one time, such as was the Prayer of our Saviour in the Garden; where, being in that great Agony, he protracted his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This sort of Perseverance is very requisite, that we may continue in this Exercise, and reap the greater Benefit, and also overcome the Nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of long and tedious Prayer. For as they who dig a Well, the deeper they go, the more Moisture they find; so those who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Prayer, the deeper they plunge into it, the more Benefit they generally find, which is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154273:31"/> Cause the wise Man said,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.</note>
                     <hi>That the end of Prayer was better than the beginning.</hi> For in Prayer (as in all other things) there is a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. The Beginning is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with Driness and Distraction of Thoughts, the Middle with Warmth and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the End often with great Quiet and Sweetness. So that even as Fire which begins to take hold of green Wood, does not presently raise a Flame, but works by little and little; and the longer it continues, the fiercer it burns, till after an Hour it is all thoroughly lighted; so you may be assured, the Fire of Devotion kindles by degrees, in such manner; that being at first quite dead, about the middle it is lighted, and at the end all in a Flame. Now the Devil being sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, labours all he can to hinder us from this Benefit. To which end (as St. <hi>Basil</hi> says) he frames a Thousand Causes and Excuses to draw us from Prayer, dragging us away with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Reasons. But we (as being forewarned of this Danger) ought to be provided against him, and to persevere in this Exercise, knocking at the Gates of the Divine Mercy, unless some absolute Duty divert us. St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stochium,</hi> has these Words concerning himself, <hi>I remember I once join'd the Night to the Day, crying in Prayer, and I ceas'd not to beat my Breast till the Lord sent Rest to my Soul.</hi> Now what may not he obtain of that Abyss of Goodness and Mercy, who shall in this manner continue crying?</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Thus much may suffice to declare the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that are to accompany perfect Prayer. And if you think what is here requir'd too much, consider what is promis'd in lieu of it, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Fruit of this Virtue is so great, as no Man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:154273:31"/> can conceive, unless he have had Experience of it. For (not to use other Arguments) I have heard several Vertuous and Credible Persons say, that remembring the time when they knew not what Prayer was, and the time when first they began to apply themselves to it, and considering the Disposition of their Heart at that time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the present, they could never cease to bless God, and to wonder at the Passions and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations they then were subject to for every Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, and at the Peace and Tranquility they now enjoy, even under the great Misfortunes of their Families. And therefore, as well on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as on Account of other great Alterations they found in themselves, they became sensible of the Virtue, Omnipotency and Goodness of God, which marvellously confirm'd them in Faith, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd their Charity, and strengthned their Hope. Hence it proceeds, that encreasing in these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (which are the Fountains of all others) they encrease in all of them, and arrive at a State of wonderful Perfection.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Time for Prayer, and its Continuance.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NExt to the Conditions required in Prayer, it follows, we speak of the time, when it ought to be made. St. <hi>Basil,</hi> makes this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and answers it himself, saying, <hi>That the time of Prayer, ought to be the time of our Life.</hi> So that he appoints no certain times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would have it include all times, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154273:32"/> to the Sentence of our Saviour, who says, <hi>It behoves us always to pray, and not to faint;</hi> tho' this be not a Command, but Advice he gives us. Which how to be understood has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in another Place. For this is not to be taken Mathematically, but in a Moral Sense; that is, as incessantly as possibly we can for the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and Affairs of this Life. Amidst the which there wants not altogether Time or Opportunity to lift up the Heart to God, and appear always in his Presence, since he is really present in all places, and we have already said, that to pray is to lift up the Heart to God, which may be done in all Places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is signify'd to us by that Embassy, which <hi>Moses</hi> brought from God to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he descended from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when in the Name of God he spoke to them in this manner,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note>
                  <hi>Your selves have seen what I have done to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>how I have carried you upon the Wings of Eagles, and have taken you unto me. If therefore you will hear my Voice, and keep my Covenant, you shall be my Peculiar of all Peoples, for all the Earth is mine. And you shall be unto me a Priestly Kingdom, and a Holy Nation.</hi> This was the Prophet's Embassy. Let us see now what it is God here promises, and what he asks, when he says it shall be a Priestly Kingdom, and Holy People. We know the Office of a Priest is to pray, to appease God, and offer Sacrifice to him. This then God would have to be one of the chief Employments of that Nation he had chosen for himself. So that he would have them all be Priests, not in Dignity and Ministry, but in the Imitation of this Principal Priestly Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to Pray and Honour God. And this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154273:32"/> would he have to be the difference betwixt this Nation and all others; for the others having no such Protector, and Support; spent their Lives in strengthning and securing their Commonwealth, as those who confided in their own Force. But this Nation not depending on its own Strength, but on God; their principal Study ought to be to pray to, serve and appease God; for provided they did so, he would take upon him the Defence of those who were so employ'd. By which it appears, That the chief Weapons and Defence of Christians, are Prayers and Religion. This was confessed by <hi>Joas,</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> tho' an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; who grieving that <hi>Eliseus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Reg. 13.</note> in whom was his whole Hope and Victory, was Dying, spoke these Words, <hi>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the Driver thereof.</hi> As if he had said (so one Comment has it) thou art our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and our Bulwark; for thou art more able with thy Prayer to defend this Kingdom, than all the Chariots and Horses in it. This therefore is the Employment God then recommended, and this the Reward he promis'd. And if he requir'd this of the Faithful of those Times, much more will he require it of those that Live now, since they are in a greater State of Perfection. Wherefore you ought not to wonder that St. <hi>Basil</hi> so far extends the time of Prayer, appointing the whole Life for its Time, since the whole Life is to be directed and supported by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the same Saint beginning to Discourse of this Doctrine, says thus, <hi>As soon as Day breaks, let us begin to Pray, praising the common Creator of all Things, with Songs and Hymns; and when the Sun spreads himself over the Earth, let us begin to lay our Hands to those Enjoyments
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154273:33"/> which appertain to us; but so that we accompany them with Hymns and Prayers, which like Salt are to season all our Business and Labours, that so they may become the easier to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In another Place, discussing this Point more particularly, he says, <hi>When you sit down at Table, Pray; and when Bread is set before you, give Thanks to him that gives it you; and when you support the Weakness of the Body with the use of Wine, remember the Gift of God, who created it to chear the Heart, and strengthen Human Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. When the Hour of Dinner is past, let not the Remembrance of him that gave you to Eat pass. When you cloath your self in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, enflame your Heart with the Love of God, and as you cover your self with your Garments, give Thanks to him, who against the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Heat and Cold, provided us with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Apparel, wherewith he preserves our Life, and covers our Nakedness. When the Day ends, render Thanks to him who gave us the Sun to assist and forward the Works of the Day, and with it gave us Fire, the Moon and Stars for the Night, with many other Helps that relieve the Necessities of Life. But now the Night that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues will furnish you with other Motives to Prayer. For when you lift up your Eyes to Heaven, and consider the Beauty of those Lights which shine in it, it is but reasonable you return Thanks to the Creator of all visible Things; and adore that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Artificer, who with such great Wisdom fram'd all Things. And when at this time you reflect on the stilness of silent Night, and the quiet Sleep of all Creatures, then again adore that Lord, who with Sleep recovers us from the toils of the Day, and who after a short Refreshment enables
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154273:33"/> us again to Labour. Think not then that the whole Night is designed for Sleep, nor is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable you should suffer useless Sleep to consume one half of your Life, but rather apply one part to Sleep, and the other to Prayer.</hi> Thus far are the Words of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> wherein you may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the great Devotion of this Holy Monk and Prelate. To whose Exercises St. <hi>Hierom</hi> adds these Words. <hi>When we go out of the House, let us arm our selves with Prayer against Dangers; and when we return Home, let us first Pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Rest, so that the Body Repose not before the Soul has received its Sustenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Exercise, says St. <hi>John Climacus,</hi> was much used among those Holy Monks of his Time; who laboured much, that they might never, or in any Place, withdraw their Heart from God. And that they might not fail, (says he) because Man's Heart by reason of its own Weight still tends to Earthly Things; many of those that lived in the Monasteries, had agreed among themselves to awaken and stir up one another by certain Signs, when they were at Table, or met about the House, or in other Places. Now what could be more Sweet or Devout than this? By this you may understand what Arts and Inventions they find out, that serve God in true Fervour of Spirit, that they may never forget him.</p>

                  <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of the Time that every Good Christian ought to employ in Prayer.</head>
                  <p n="6">6. NOW to return to our Purpose, this is the time allotted by St. <hi>Basil</hi> for Prayer, and this is it that every Man who does seriously and heartily apply himself to God ought to aim at; for altho' he cannot attain this Continuance, yet the more he labours to attain it, the nearer he will approach to it. Every Christian ought at least to endeavour to take so much time for Prayer every Day, as will suffice to furnish his Heart with Devotion, Recollection, and Fortitude against all Accidents. So that as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> gather'd as much of the <hi>Manna</hi> God sent them in the Desart, as sufficed for their Maintenance that Day; so we ought every Day to labour for as much Devotion, as will serve to maintain the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life that Day, without fainting under Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor declining to Sin; for Prayer and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the Sustenance of Spiritual Life, as <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was of the Corporeal. Therefore as in the Corporeal, there was Natural Heat which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to be maintain'd by that Food; so in the Spiritual, there is another Pestilential Heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Corrupt Nature and Human Life, which stands no less in need of this continual Support. This St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Pastoral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares and recommends to us thus; <hi>Because our Heart grows distracted and cold with Talking, and the daily Conversing with Men lessens the Care and Circumspection we ought to have in what relates to God; it is therefore convenient continually to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154273:34"/> make up this Defect by the Mediation of the Words of Holy Writ. And because the Company of Worldly Men draws us to the Customs of the former Life, it is requisite that the Practice of Compunction always renew in us the Love of our Heavenly Country. And since we see that the turmoil of Business daily casts down our Heart, it is necessary always to endeavour to raise it by the practice of Prayer and Meditation.</hi> Thus far St. <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now according to this Doctrine, the true Servant of God ought to call himself to account, and proportion the daily Expence of his Conscience to the Condition of his Life; and accordingly so to order his Receipt, that all the Expence caus'd by the wicked inclinations of our Flesh, may be made good by Spiritual Devotion; and what we lose by Conversing with Men, may be recover'd by Conferring with God.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. NOW it is very proper for the attaining of this End, to reserve certain appointed Hours of Day and Night, in which we may without Business freely and wholly apply our <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:154273:35"/>9. Two set Times are particularly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Use, to wit, the Morning and Evening. This the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> Demonstrates by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when he says, <hi>My Soul hast desir'd thee in the Night,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai 26.</note>
                     <hi>yea, and with my Spirit in my Heart I will watch to thee in the Morning.</hi> And the Holy King <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>My Eyes awaked early, O Lord, in the Morning, to meditate on the Word<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154273:35"/> shut out all other Thoughts; for at that time the Soul is so sprightly and well disposed, and the first Impression it takes so grounded in it, that it is afterwards very hard to be rubbed out. Wherefore St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>Take not away your Heart from God either by Day or Night; and as soon as you have cast Sleep from your Eyes, let your Senses immediately watch to Prayer.</hi> And so great is the Advantage this Labour produces, that for the most part a Man's Life is Regular all the Day, when he well performs the Morning Prayer. Therefore St. <hi>John Climacus</hi> writes, That one of the Holy Fathers of the Desart had told him, that by his Morning Prayer he perceiv'd the Sequel of the whole Day; for as his Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer prov'd, so generally all succeeded with him the same Day.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT remains now to show that there are Two Sorts of Prayer, One perform'd only by the Heart, (and is therefore called Mental) which is when we think with Attention on the Things of God, and represent our Wants to that Lord, who as plainly understands the Language of the Heart, as that of the Tongue. Of the Subject of this sort of Prayer, we shall speak in the ensuing Treatise. There is another sort of Prayer, which to the Voice of the Heart, adds the Words of the Mouth, which is called Vocal. This is very
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154273:36"/> beneficial to all sorts of Persons, but particularly to Beginners, if it be perform'd with due Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Devotion.

To this same intent, our Holy Mother, the Church, inspir'd by the Holy Ghost, ordain'd the Singing of the Psalms, and of the rest of the Divine Office, to stir up by those Heavenly Voices the Devotion of those that Pray. Where not only the Virtue and Meaning of the Words, but also the Sweetness and Melody of the Voices, pierces the Heart, and provokes Devotion, as we Read of the same St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who shed many Tears, and felt great inward Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hearing the Song and Hymns of the Voices that Harmoniously resounded in the Church. For (as a Philosopher said) Musick is naturally so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to our Soul, that even Children in the Cradle are hush'd and fall asleep with the sweetness of their Mother's Voices, who Sing to them Delightfully.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But as Holy Words help to rouze Devotion when it is asleep, so when it is once awak'd and enflam'd, they may often be a hindrance to it. For when the Soul is wrapped in some great Affection and Sense of the Love or Fear of God, or in the Admiration of his Works, then would it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be motionless, and not stir thence, where the Holy Ghost gives it that Feeling; and it is a great trouble to it, so speak or think of any other Thing. And by how much the more the whole strength of the Soul is here gather'd to enjoy this Blessing God bestows on it, so much the more the Tongue is tied up, and all the other Members and Senses are less fit to play their own parts, or attend to any other Thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now when at any time a Man finds himself in this Disposition, and perceives that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Words is some hindrance to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, he ought immediately to leave off Words
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154273:37"/> (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says, 22. Q. 83. Ar. 12.) because it is not reasonable that what was Instituted for the advancement of Devotion, should be an Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to that Devotion, for which it was Ordained. By which it appears, that certain Devout Persons are, who receiving, as they Pray in their Books, or on their Beads, from our Lord some singular Devotion or Tenderness; and perceiving that by proceeding, they obstruct that Sweetness and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness which was given them upon that Point where they were; yet they proceed, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that this is flying from what they seek, and despising what they already have; since it is manifest, that all this was ordain'd for Devotion, and that Devout Words are so much the more or less profitable, by how much the more or less they tend to this end. True it is, this is not to be understood in Publick Prayers, which were Instituted for Edification of the People; nor in those which Man is oblig'd to by Vow, or other like Duty, but only in those he makes of his free Will to excite Devotion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And because, generally speaking, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Prayer Man is cold, and about the middle or end grows more warm (as was declared above) therefore it is good Advice, when he finds himself so (which is always, or for the most part) that he begin by Vocal Prayer, and end in Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; saying, first by Book, or by Heart, those Prayers he has deputed for this purpose; and then when his Devotion begins to be inflam'd, let him proceed to the other sort of Prayer; employing his Thought on some Passage of the Life of our Saviour, or on some of his Benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with him, or giving him Thanks for Mercies receiv'd, or begging of him new Graces,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154273:37"/> as shall be hereafter declar'd. This Advice is very proper for those who have not so easie an access to Devotion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thus much may suffice for an Introduction to this Treatise, in which are set down sundry Prayers for various Times and Purposes; and to ask of our Lord several Virtues, as by them will appear. Particularly there are fourteen Prayers, whereof seven briefly contain the principal Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Mysteries of the Life of Christ; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seven are the Exercise and Practice of some eminent Virtues, whose whole Scope is to Love, Fear, and Hope in God; to give him Thanks for his Mercies, and Praise his Perfections. Which Prayers, he that has Time may divide among the Days of the Week, for the better Exciting of Devotion, and thus avoid the Irksomeness that proceeds from repeating the same Thing every Day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To conclude all these Preambles, I again urge, That he who Prays, must labour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his Prayer with the Conditions before set down, if he would enjoy the great Advantages ascrib'd to this Virtue. For they who do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, will reap little or no benefit by their Prayer. Which is the Reason that in these Days we see many who Pray much, and yet are as full of their Passions, Avarice, Vanity and Pride, as those who in all their Life never knew what it was to Pray; and that because their Prayer is not accompany'd with the foresaid Qualifications; which is not to be attributed to any defect in Prayer it self, but to the Negligence of those who make not good use of it, which ought to be carefully avoided.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:154273:38"/>
               <p>Here follow Seven very Devout Prayers, in which are Briefly contain'd all the Principal Mysteries of the most Holy Humanity of Christ our Saviour; that is, all the Passages of his Life, and Precious Death, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry One may Distribute among the Days of the Week; repeating One every Day, and endeavouring Attentively and Sedately to consider and weigh what by each of these Mysteries is represented to us.</p>

I Give thee most hearty Thanks, O sweet Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who for me didst vouchsafe to descend from thy Royal Mansion, and from the most high Bosom of thy Father into this Vale of Misery, and to take upon thee Human Flesh in the most Chaste Womb of the most Holy Virgin thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I humbly beseech thee, O Lord, that thou wilt prepare my Heart for this Dwelling, and that to this purpose thou enrich and adorn it with Virtue, that thou alone may'st for ever inhabit there. O that this Habitation were such, that I might deserve humbly to invite thee to it; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee in it lovingly, and to entertain thee there constantly. O that I might embrace thee with such strong Bonds of Love, that I might never ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Thought or Affection stray from thee.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:154273:38"/>2. I give thee most humble Thanks, O sweet Jesus, who didst ordain, that the most Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, after thy Conception, should go visit her Kinswoman <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to salute and attend her during her being with Child. In her most pure Bowels thou didst not disdain to be hid the space of Nine Months. Grant me the Grace of true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and imprint it in the bottom of my Heart, that tho' I may always be found dispos'd for thy Service, grant, O Lord, that my Heart may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a loathing to Worldly Things, and may ever desire, and be covetous to have thee to possess and dwell in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I give thee Thanks, most sweet Jesus, whom the most blessed Virgin bore without Pain, and without Detriment to her Virgin Purity, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee as a poor and passible Creature in a Manger, humbly adored and worshipped thee! May it please thy Mercy, that thou may'st be continually born in me, through a new Fervor of Charity; and may it please thee, O Lord, to be the only Desire, the only Sweetness, and only Hope of my Heart. O that I might ever seek only thee, think only on thee, and with most ardent Affection love only thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I give thee Thanks, most sweet Jesus, who didst not refuse being Born in the coldest Season, to be wrapp'd in poor Blankets, and suck at thy Mother's Breast like an helpless Infant. Grant, O Lord, that I may alway be in thy Presence a true Child, humble and truly poor in Spirit. Grant that for the sake of thy Holy Name I may willingly undergo any Adversities and Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that I love nothing belonging to this World, but in thee, and desire to possess none out of thee.</p>

I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who being new Born, wast with pleasing Songs prais'd by the Angels, and whom the Shepherds devoutly sought and ador'd with great Joy and Amazement. Grant me, O Lord, that I may persevere with Alacrity in thy Praise, and may seek thee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently with the Shepherds, and seeking, may find possess thee for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who wouldst on the Eighth Day (according to the Custom of other Children) be Circumcis'd; and being yet but an Infant, shed Blood, and to our wonderful Consolation be called Jesus. May it please thee, O Lord, to account and set me down in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thy Servants, and to Circumcise from my Soul all that is Disorderly, or Extravagant; that is, all ill Words, Deeds, and wild Thoughts. Thou, O Lord, art called Jesus, that is, Saviour, because to thee alone it belongs to give Salvation. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee therefore, O Lord, that with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this most delightful Name, I may drive from me all disorderly Pusilanimity and Faintness, and that by it I may gain a secure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thy Mercy, and that it may defend me from all the Snares and Persecutions of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, whom the Wise Men seeking, with wonderful Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion found, by the leading of a bright Star, and falling down before thee, offer'd Gold, Mirrh and Frankincense. Grant me, that with these Holy Men I may always seek thee in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my Heart, and there adore thee in Spirit and Truth, and that with them I offer thee Gold of shining Charity, Frankincense of Devotion, and Mirrh of perfect Mortification; and in short, that I may employ and bury all the Strength of my Soul, in doing thy Holy Will.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:154273:40"/>8. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who to give us an Example of Obedience and Humility, wouldst for us submit thy self to the Law, and be carry'd to the Temple in the Arms of thy most Holy Mother, and have the Offering of the Poor offer'd for thee, where the just <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> the Prophetess, rejoicing at thy Presence, gave sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Testimony of thy Glory. O that my Heart might never be touch'd with the least Spark of Vanity! O that all manner of Pride might be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd far from me, that all Desire of Worldly Favour might be extinguish'd in me, and all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Love of my self! Grant me, O Lord, that I may fly from all Human Praise, and that I submit my self to all Men for thy sake, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey them all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who being yet a little Infant, with thy tender Mother wast presently Persecuted, and didst not disdain to fly, and be banish'd into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Grant that in all the Storms of my Persecutions, and in all my Tribulations and Temptations, I may have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to thee alone, seek thee alone, and call thee alone; and that whatever I receive from thy Hand, I may joyfully accept thereof, and bear it with a meek Heart, always giving thee Thanks for whatsoever shall come from thee.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, whom thy loving Mother (when thou remainedst in the Temple) was three Days a seeking, and at the end of them, with great Joy, found thee in the midst of the Doctors, hearing and arguing with them most learnedly. O that thou wouldst so give and communicate thy self to me, that thou mightest never more put me from thee, or forsake me. Shake, O Lord, from my Heart all Sloth, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

Be pleased before my Soul departs from this Flesh, to make me such as thou wouldst have me to be; that at my leaving this Pilgrimage and Banishment, I may immediately be united with thee, where I may see and enjoy thee in that blessed Eternity, which has no end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Desart among wild Beasts before the Preaching of the Gospel, and persevering Forty Days and Forty Nights in Fasting, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching with Sighs and Prayers, didst permit thy self to be tempted by Satan, and after Victory obtained, wast feasted and attended by Angels. Grant that thro' thy Grace I may subdue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all my Vicious Inclinations, and with like Perseverance as thou didst, may employ my self
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154273:41"/> in Fasting, Watching, Prayer, and other Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Exercises. But particularly grant me, that with the Assistance of thy Grace I may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Vice of Gluttony, and from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Snares and Contrivances of the Devil. Let no Temptation defile me, none separate me from thee, but rather may they all be a Motive to me, to have always Recourse to thee, and to embrace, and be strictly united to thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who wast for me afflicted in this World with many Sufferings and Wants; with Cold, Heat, Hunger and Thirst; with Weariness, Sweat, Travel and Watching; and with Persecutions and Contradictions of sundry sorts. Grant, O Lord, that I may joyfully receive all Adversities, as given by thee, and that I suffer then for thy Love with a patient Heart; and that in any Contentment or Grief in any Disaster, or other Accident, I may still rest unmov'd in thee, endeavouring always, that thy Will, and not mine, be fulfill'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst endure much Labour, seeking (as a true Pastor and Redeemer of the World) after the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Souls, watching in Prayer, tiring thy self in Travel, declaring the Heavenly Doctrine, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing from Country to Country, from City to City, from Village to Village, and from Castle to Castle. Grant me thy Grace, O Lord, that I may never become slothful in what belongs to thy Service, but may rather always be ready and active to all that is good. Grant me that I may most ardently covet the Salvation of all Men, and (as much as in me is) endeavour it, and that ever, and in all Places, I be zealous of thy Honour, and wholly employ my self in it.</p>

Grant me a Heart full of tender Affection, and Holy Compassion towards all Men, that I may pity their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and be sensible of the Miseries of others, as if they were my own, that I may equally bear with the Imperfections of all Men, and, as much as lies in my Power, relieve their Necessities. Cleanse, O Lord, and heal my Soul of all Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Passions, and Evil Inclinations which molest it, that being cur'd of all these Diseases, and loos'd from all these Letts, it may freely soar on high, and never rest, till through most pure Love it merit to attain thy Divine Embraces.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who for me didst suffer many Wrongs, Blasphemies, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings, Slanders and Persecutions from those same Men, who receiv'd of thee so much Good.

               <p>I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy self to be carry'd by arm'd Men, bound as a Thief and Malefactor to the House of <hi>Annas,</hi> and to appear in Judgment before him. O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Meekness of my Redeemer, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, bound, and ill treated, thou dost not complain, mutter, or resist, but silently follow those that lead thee, obey those that command thee, and with unparallell'd Patience bear with those that torment thee! Grant, O Lord, that the Examples of so many and so excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may shine out in me, to the Honour and Glory of thy most Holy Name.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, King of Heaven and Earth, who standing before the proud High Priest, as if thou hadst been a Mean and Contemptible Person, didst meekly endure the Inhumane Buffet given thee on the Face by one of his Officers. Curb, O Lord, in me all Sallies of Anger and Fierceness, mortifie all Heats of Rancour and Passion, and quench all Sparks of Covetousness and Revenge; that when I am

Thou well know'st, my Lord, how hard it is to me to endure even things of small Moment. Thou well knowest, I have no Virtue, that my Will is backward, and all my good Desires cold.

O King of Glory, where could'st thou, O Lord, more debase the Grandeur of thy Majesty? It plainly appears thou art the Living Stone which Men rejected, and God chose for himself. O that I might prefer nothing before thee, or part with thee for any other thing, but rather esteem all things as Dirt compar'd with thee. Grant, O
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154273:45"/> Lord, that the Poyson of Envy may never infect my Soul, but that in thee alone I may repose, and in thee alone find my Salvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst suffer thy most Sacred and Virgin Flesh to be stripp'd naked, ty'd to a Pillar, and there most cruelly scourg'd, to the Intent thy Wounds might heal ours. Disrobe, O Lord, my Heart of all shameful Thoughts, disarray me of the Old Man with all his Works, and cloath me with the New, who like thee is created in Justice and true Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and grant that I endure with all possible Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Obedience the Scourges of thy Fatherly Correction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who after receiving so many Scourges, and shedding so much Blood, wast in cruel manner Scoff'd at, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided; for in Contempt they cloath'd thee in Scarlet, they thrust upon thy Divine Head a Crown of Thorns, put into thy Hand a Cane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Scepter, and in Scorn kneeling before thee, they saluted thee, saying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews.</hi> Fix in my Heart, O Lord, the continual Remembrance of this painful Passage, and wound it with the piercing Darts of thy Charity. Grant that I may love, think, and securely repose only in thee, and that no Tribulation, no Affliction, no Persecution may separate me from thee, nor may I think it a Disgrace, to be contemn'd and despis'd with thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the other Injuries and ill Treatments thou enduredst for me, wouldst also carry the heavy Cross as far as <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> with great Labour and Pain of thy Body, on thy tender Shoulders. Grant, O Lord, that I may embrace thy Cross with

               <p n="1">1. I Give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst come to the Place of Sacrifice, tir'd with the Weight of the Cross; and there being Thirsty, and spent, they gave thee to drink Vinegar, mix'd with Gall. O that hereby thou wouldst destroy in me all Sense of Gluttony, and all Delights of the Flesh, and wouldst cause that at no time I should admit of any unseemly Delight. Grant me then, O Lord, that most becoming and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Virtue of Moderation in Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all disorderly Appetites of Gluttony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154273:46"/> curb'd, I may only Hunger and Thirst after thee, and in thee alone may I place all my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst permit thy self to be stripp'd naked in sight of all the People, where tearing thy Cloaths from thee, thy Wounds were renew'd, the Blood again gush'd out, and thy Pains were increas'd. Grant me, my God, true Love of Poverty, and give me Grace, that I may never be afflicted for any thing I want. Grant me a patient suffering of all the Wants and Misfortunes of this Life; deliver my Heart from all Worldly Thoughts and Affections, and daily renew in me fervent Desires of thy Holy Love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst not refuse to be cruelly stretch'd upon the Cross, to have thy most Sacred Limbs disjointed, and thy Hands and Feet pierc'd with sharp Nails, and fix'd to the said Cross. Grant, O Lord, that with a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Thankful Soul I may ever be mindful of this thy most ardent Charity, wherewith thou so mercifully didst stretch forth thy Arms, and open thy Hands, that they might be nail'd, and didst deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy Feet to be bor'd. Dilate, O Lord, my Soul with perfect Charity, pierce and nail with the same Nail of thy Love all my Sences, and confine all my T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst hang Three Hours suffering upon the disgraceful Tree of the Cross, and shedding thy Blood plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, didst feel most piercing Pains in all thy Limbs. Fix, O Lord, to that same Tree this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Soul that lyes grov'ling upon the Ground, and with the Streams of thy Blood cleanse it from the Flesh of its Sins, and deprav'd Appetites. O Sacred Blood, that givest Life and Salvation. Be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154273:46"/> pleas'd, O Lord, to wash me with that Blood▪ to cleanse and purifie me with that Liquor of Mercy. Be pleas'd, O Lord, to offer it up to thy Father for a full Satisfaction of all my Sins, and Cure of all my Diseases. I beseech thee, that thro' most Affectionate Love I may deserve to drink with my Heart and lick up with the Tongue of my Soul, the most precious Drops of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Blood, and that so I may taste the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Spirit, and the Delight of that Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquor.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who for my Sake wouldst be placed betwixt Two Thieves, and reputed as one of them, that thy Incredible Humility and Patience might remove, and utterly destroy our Pride and Impatience. Raise up my Spirit, O Lord, that being placed on high, I may thence despise all that is in this World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, love, and think only on thee, sigh only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, speak of thee, dream of thee, relish thee, and delight in thee, and desire no Contentment without thee.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who wast so good, even to the most wicked, as to pray even for those that Crucify'd thee, saying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Grant me, O Lord, the Grace of true Patience and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wherewith (according to thy Example and Commandment) I may love my Enemies, and do Good to those that do me Hurt, humbly pray to thee for, and heartily forgive them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, whom thy most perverse Enemies scorn'd with Horrid Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, whilst thou didst suffer intolerable Pain and Anguish on the Cross. Grant, O Lord, that remembring the ineffable Humility and Patience,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154273:47"/> wherewith you sustained so many Pains and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, I may manfully endure the like, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe with thee on the Cross of Patience until Death. Let no Violence of Temptations, no Storm of Afflictions, nor Hurrican of Injuries, drive me from my good Purpose; let not Death or Life, what's present, or to come, separate me from thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst suffer one of the two Thieves to scoff at thee, and didst promise the Glory of Paradise to the other, who confess'd his own Guilt, and with lively Faith declar'd thy Innocence. O that I were so happy as to deserve to be look'd upon with those Eyes of Mercy, with which didst behold that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Theif, that with the Assistance of thy Grace I might lead so innocent a Life, that whilst yet living, I might deserve to hear from thee that most comfortable Word, <hi>This Day thou shalt be with me in Paradice.

               <p n="1">1. I Give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who from the Cross, seeing thy Mother full of Grief and Tears, your Heart pitying her Anguish, didst recommend her to thy Disciple St. <hi>John,</hi> and then didst recommend the Disciple to her, and in him all us. Grant then that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and honour this Lady with most Ardent Love, that esteeming her as a Mother, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154273:47"/> that she look upon me as a Son, and use me as such. Grant that she may assist me in all my Necessities, but chiefly at the Hour of my Death. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I give thee Thanks, most sweet Jesus, who whilst thy Wounds were yet gaping, thy Head crown'd with Thorns, and hanging on the Cross, didst say, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> Grant, that in all my Adversities, Temptations and Afflictions, I may have Recourse to thee, merciful Father, and without relying on my self, may only confide in thee, and resign my self up into thy Hands. Pierce, O Lord, the Bowels of my Soul with the Remembrance of thy Wounds, imprint them in the bottom of my Heart, inebriate me so with thy Blood, that I may think of, nor seek nothing but thee, that I may find, hold and possess thee for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who being now spent, and wither'd with the Greatness of thy Torments and Effusion of so much Blood, and being parch'd with Thirst, and the vehement De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of our Salvation, didst say, <hi>I thirst.</hi> Give me, O Lord, a most Ardent Thirst after thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Salvation of Souls, that pursuant to thy Holy Will, I may wholly employ my self in thy Service, so far forth as my Condition will permit me. Grant that no Love of Transitory Things may possess, no Creature ensnare me, and that such things as ought to be lov'd, I may love in thee, and thee above them all, and that in thee alone be all my Repose.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who at the Hour of thy Death didst permit that to quench thy Thirst, they should put to thy Mouth a Spunge full of Vinegar, to the end, that tasting
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154273:48"/> in that Agony this Comfortless Refreshment, thou might'st make Satisfaction to the Eternal Father for all our Gluttony and Delights, and leave us a wonderful Example of Poverty and Hardship.

Grant, O Lord, that thou alone may'st be the Center, to which may tend all my Thoughts, Words, and Actions; that in all things, with a Pure and Chaste Intention I may seek only thy Honour, and desire or look for nothing without thee. Grant that I may never grow cold and faint in thy Service, but that daily renewing my Fervour of Spirit, I may press on to serve and praise thee.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who of thy own Accord didst call upon Death, leaning down thy Venerable Head, and recommending thy Soul to thy Father, didst take leave of thy Flesh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating thereby to us, that thou art the good Shepherd, who didst lay down thy Life for thy Flock. Grant, O Lord, that I may die to all my Vices, and evil Inclinations, and that I live only in thee, and be sensible only of thee; that ending the Course of this Life in true Charity, I may enter

               <p n="1">1. I Give thee Thanks, sweet Jesus, who didst powerfully descend to Hell; where crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of the Devil, thou didst with thy Presence rejoice the Ancient Fathers, who were there confin'd, and delivering them from their Imprisonment and Darkness, didst carry them to the Delights of Paradice.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>WHen thou sittest down</hi> (saith the wise Man) <hi>at the Table of the Powerful Man, consider diligently what is set before thee, that thereby thou maist understand what thou art to prepare.</hi> Now according to this Rule, he that approaches to converse with God in Prayer, must first fix his Thoughts on the Lord he is about to converse with, and seriously consider his Greatness; for it is requisite his Heart and his Affections be suitable to him he appears before. Let him therefore humbly lift up his Eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him seated in the Throne of his Majesty above all created Beings; and let him consider it is he who has the Title of his Dignity embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on his Garment, and on his Thigh, which Title is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; as also that he is infinitely Perfect, Beautiful, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Good, Merciful, Just, Terrible and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; and that he is also a most Loving Father, most Bountiful Benefactor, and Merciful Redemer, and Saviour. And when he has thus consider'd him, let him next ponder with what Virtue and Affection he ought to answer these Titles; and he will find, that as God he deserves to be ador'd, as infinitely Perfect and Glorious to be Prais'd, as inexpressibly Good and Beautiful to be Lov'd, as most Just and Terrible to be Fear'd, as Lord and King of all Things Obey'd; on account of his Benefits he deserves a Thousand Blessings and Thanks for being our Creator and Redeemer, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154273:50"/> deserves we should offer up to him all we are, as being all his own; and as being our Helper and Saviour, it is convenient we ask of him Relief in all our Necessities. These and the like Acts of Virtue are due from a Rational Creature, to these Titles and Perogatives of its Creator. So that Adoration is due to his Divinity, Praise to his Perfections, Thanks to his Benefits, Love to his Goodness, Fear to his Justice, Hope to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Obedience to the Power of his Majesty, an Oblation of all Things to his Dominion over them, and the asking all Things of him to his continual Relieving and Forgiving us. These are the Virtues and Affections wherewith we ought on our side to make returns to this Lord, who, as he is all Things, so he requires to be Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd and Worshipp'd with all these Affections and Submissions. Which, tho' they be virtually exercis'd, and interfere with all Works done for the Love of him, yet are they more particularly practis'd in Prayer, which handles all these Things. To this end, were the seven following Prayers made, for the performing of these Duties in some measure; and they are gather'd from sundry Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saints and Prophets, but more especially from the Psalms and the Holy St. <hi>Augustin.</hi> Now because the Just Man is at first his own Accuser, and the direct Way to God is through Penance and Humility; therefore before Prayer, a Man ought to repeat the General Confession, or one of the Penitential Psalms, with the greatest Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he can; and that done, he may begin his Prayer.</p>

               <head type="sub">The First Prayer, wherein the Creature humbly adores its Creator, pondering the Greatness of his Majesty, for which he deserves to be ador'd as God; saying, as follows.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF the Publican in the Gospel durst not lift up his Eyes to Heaven, but from afar beat his Breast,<note place="margin">Luc. 18. Luc. 7.</note> saying, <hi>Lord God, have Mercy on me a Sinner;</hi> and the Holy Penitent <hi>Magdalen</hi> durst not appear before the Face of our Lord, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about behind his Back fell down at his Feet, and with Tears in her Eyes, obtain'd Pardon of her Sins. And if the Holy Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> being to confer with thee, said, <hi>I will Talk with my Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>tho' I be Dust and Ashes;</hi> if these being so good, were thus Humble and Prostrate when they appear'd before thy Majesty, what shall so Poor and Miserable a Sinner as I am do? What shall Dust and Corruption do? What shall the Abyss of Sin and Misery do? But because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, O Lord, attain that Fear and Reverence which is due to thy Majesty, but by fixing my Eyes upon it; give me leave that I may dare lift up my weak Eyes to thee, so that the Splendor of thy Glory may not dazle the Tenderness of my Sight. I am sensible thou art that Great God who surpasses our Wisdom, I am satisfy'd no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Understanding can comprehend thee; yet nevertheless, tho' none comprehend, none can do better than to look steadily on thee. O Supream, most Omnipotent, most Merciful, most Just, most Secret, most Present, most Beautiful, most Strong, most Solid and Incomprehensible, most Simple,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154273:51"/> Perfect, and Invisible, yet seeing all Things, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, yet changing all Things; to whom no distance of Time is a delay, nor streightness of Place a confinement; whom Variety does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor Necessity corrupt; nor Adversity disturb, nor Success please; from whom Forgetfulness takes nothing, and to whom Memory cannot add; to whom things past are not gone, nor the future to come; to whom no Cause gave beginning, nor times any Encrease, nor will Accidents give an end; because from all Eternity thou art Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent for ever. Thou art he who at once grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ends of the World, and sweetly disposeth all things. Thou art he who without any need created all things, dost preserve them without Weariness, dost govern them without Labour, and dost move them without being mov'd. Thou art all Eyes, all Feet, and all Hands. All Eyes, because thou seest all things; all Feet, because thou supportest all things; and all Hands, because thou makest all things. Thou art in all things, yet not confin'd; without all things, yet not cast off; under all things, yet not deprest; above all things, yet not exalted. O supreame and true God, supream and true Life, by whom, and for whom all things live, that live truly and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thou, O Lord, art Goodness and Beauty it self, by whom, and for whom, all that is Good and Beautiful, is Good and Beautiful. Thou art he that commands us to ask, and causes us to find thee, and does open to us when we knock. Thou art he from whom to separate is to fall, to whom to approach is to rise, and in whom to abide is to be permanent. Thou art he from whom no Body departs, unless he is deceiv'd; whom no Body seeks, unless well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd; and whom no Body finds, unless he be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd. Thou art he, whom to know is to live, whom

Even so I the vilest of all Creatures do adore and worship thee a thousand times, confessing thou art my true God and Lord, and that all I have, live and hope for, is thine; and therefore I beseech all Creatures, that they jointly with me praise and adore thee; and in order to it, I call upon and invite them to this purpose, with the Words of the Song of thy Prophet, which are these.</p>

His also is the Sea, and he made it, and his Hands founded the Earth.

                  <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thy Fury, nor chastise me in thy Wrath. Have Mercy on me, Lord, because I am weak; heal me, Lord, because all my Bones are troubled. And my Soul is troubled exceedingly, but thou, Lord, how long? Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my Soul; save me for thy Mercy, because there is not in Death, that is mindful of thee; and in Hell, who shall confess to thee.</hi> Thou that livest and reignest for ever and ever, World without end. <hi>Amen.

               <p n="1">1. IT were fit, O Lord, that I spent all my Life in the Exercise of Fear and Penance;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154273:55"/> since I have so much to fear, and to bewail. Yet nevertheless, the Greatness of thy Glory, no less obliges us to praise and glorifie, than to worship and adore thee; for to thee alone is the Hymn and Praise due in <hi>Sion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 64.</note> for being (as thou art) an Ocean of all Perfections, a Sea of Wisdom, of Omnipotency, of Beauty, of Riches, of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of Sweetness, and of Majesty, wherein are all the Perfections and Accomplishments of all Celestial and Terrestrial Creatures, and all in the Supream Degree of Perfection. For compar'd with thee, all Beauty is Deformity, all Riches is Poverty, all Power is Weakness, all Wisdom is Ignorance, all Sweetness is Bitterness; and in short, all that shines in Heaven and Earth is much less in thy Presence than a small Candle before the Sun. Thou art Perfect without Deformity, Great without Quantity, Good without Quality, Strong without Infirmity, True without Falshood, every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Present without being in any Place, every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Entire, without filling up Space; in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Infinite, in Power Omnipotent, in Goodness Supream, in Wisdom Inestimable, in Counsel Terrible, in Judgment Just, in Thoughts most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, in thy Word Unerring, in thy Works Holy, in thy Mercies Superabundant, towards Sinners most Patient, and towards the Penitent most Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then what shall I say, O Lord, of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Wisdom?<note place="margin">Psal. 138.</note>
                  <hi>Thou, O Lord,</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>hast understood my Cogitations far off, my Path and my Cord thou hast searched out. And thou hast foreseen all my Ways, because there is not a Word in my Tongue, which thou knowest not. Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, and them of old; thou hast formed me, and hast
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154273:55"/> put thy Hand upon me. Thy Knowledge is become marvellous of me; it is made great, and I cannot reach to it. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, and whither shall I fly from thy Face? If I shall ascend into Heaven, thou art there; if I descend into Hell, thou art present. If I shall take Wings early, and dwell in the extream Parts of the Sea, thither also shall thy Hand conduct me, and thy Right Hand shall hold me. And I said, perhaps Darkness shall tread over me, and the Night is mine Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my Delights. For Darkness shall not be darkned from thee, and the Night shall be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the Day.</hi>

The Heavens are thine, and the Earth is thine; the round Earth, and the Fulness thereof thou hast founded. The North and the Sea thou hast created:</hi> Thabor <hi>and</hi> Hermon <hi>shall rejoice in thy Name; thy Arm is with Might.</hi> Nor does Holy <hi>Job</hi> speak less loftily of the Omnipotence, where he says, <hi>With him is Wisdom and Strength; he hath Counsel and Understanding.

Thine is my Body, with all its Members and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; thine is my Soul, with all its Faculties and Powers; thine are all the Hours and Moments I have hitherto lived; thine the Strength and Health thou hast given me; thine the Heaven and Earth that sustains me; thine the Sun, Moon and Stars, the Fields, Birds and Fishes, the Beasts, and all other Creatures, that in Obedience to thy Command serve me. All this, O Lord, is thine, and for it I give thee as many Thanks as possibly I can. Yet much greater Thanks I give thee, for that thou didst vouchsafe to be mine, since thou didst offer up, and lay thy self wholly out for my Redemption; for me thou wast Cloathed with Flesh, for me Born in a Stable, Laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Wrapped in Clouts, Circumcis'd the Eighth Day, Banish'd to <hi>Egypt;</hi> so many several Ways Tempted, Persecuted, Misused, Scourg d▪ Crown'd, Disgrac'd, Sentenc'd to Death, and Nail'd upon a Cross. For me didst thou Fast, Pray, Watch, Weep, Travel, and endure the greatest Pains and Affronts that ever were endur'd. For me thou didst Ordain and Contrive the Medicines of thy Sacraments, compounded with the Moisture of thy Blood, and particularly the greatest of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which is thy most Holy Body) where thou, my God, art in Person my Cure, my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance, my Strength, my Delight, my Pledge of Hope, and a strong Testimony of thy Love.

He will not be angry always; neither will he threaten for ever. He hath not done with us according to our Sins; neither according to our Iniquities hath he rewarded us. For according to the Height of Heaven from the Earth, hath he strengthned his Mercy upon them that fear him. As far as the East is distant from the West, hath he made our Iniquities far from us. As a Father hath Compassion of his Children, so hath our Lord Compassion of them that fear him; because he hath known our making. He remembred that we are Dust; Man, his Days are as Grass, as the Flower of the Field, so shall he flourish. Because the Spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not stand; and he shall know his place no more. But the Mercy of our Lord from everlasting; and unto everlasting to them that fear him.

               <head type="sub">The Fifth Prayer to beg the Love of God.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF our Obligation, O Lord, be great to our Benefactors, and if every Benefit receiv'd be, as it were, an Incentive and Spur to Love, and according to the quantity of Fuel so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the Fire is the greater; then how great a Flame of Love ought to be rais'd in my Heart, being kindled by so infinite a quantity of Fuel, as are thy Benefits? If all this visible and invisible World be thy Benefit towards me, how great a Conflagration of Love ought they all to cause? Nor yet is it for this alone that I ought to love thee, but also for that in thee alone are found all the Motives and Reasons for Love that can be imagin'd in all Creatures, and all of them in the Supream Degree of Perfection. For if we look upon Goodness, who is more Good than thou? If upon Beauty, who more Beautiful than thou? If upon Sweetness and Mildness, who more Sweet or Mild? If upon Riches and Wisdom, who more Rich and Wise? If upon Friendship, who loves us more than he that suffer'd so much for us? If upon Benefits, whose is all we have but thine? If upon Hope, from whom do we hope for all we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154273:58"/> want but from thy Mercy? If so great Love be naturally due to Parents, who is more a Father than he that saith, <hi>Call none Father upon Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 2.</note>
                  <hi>for only he is your Father, who is in Heaven?</hi> If a Consort is so passionately belov'd, who but thou is the Spouse of my Soul, and who but thou fills the empty Space of my Heart and Wishes? If, as Philosophers say, our utmost End be infinitely beloved, who but thou is my Beginning and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most End? Whence came I, and whether do I tend but to thee? To conclude, if Likeness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Love, after whose Image and Likeness but thine was my Soul created? Now if this and each of the other Motives be of it self suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to excite Love, how great must that be which proceeds from them all together? Doubtless, as much as the Sea exceeds all Rivers that fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, so much this Love ought to exceed all others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If then, my God, I have so many Reasons to love, why then shall I not love thee with all my Heart, with all my Strength, and with all my Soul? O all my Hope, all my Glory, and all my Joy! O my Amiable Beginning and Support, when shall I love thee with all my Strength, and with all my Soul? When shall I please thee in all things? When will all that is in me displeasing to thee be mortify'd? When shall I cease to be my own? When shall nothing besides thee live in me? When shall the Fire of thy Love enflame me? When wilt thou snatch away, plunge and transport me in thee? When, removing all Obstacles and Letts, wilt thou make me of the same Spirit with thee, that I may never depart from thee? O my God, what will it cost thee to do me so great Good? What wilt thou have the less? What wilt thou expend? Why then, O Lord, who art an
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154273:59"/> Abyss of Infinite Bounty and Goodness, dost thou in thy Anger withhold thy Mercies from me? Why shall my Crimes outweigh thy Goodness? Why shall my Sins be of more force to damn, than thy Goodness to save me? If thou regard Sorrow and Repentance, I am so sorry for having offended thee, that I had rather I had suffer'd a Thousand Deaths, than have once provok'd thee. If it is Satisfaction thou stand'st upon, behold here this miserable Body, pour forth the Fury of thy Wrath upon it, provided thou lessen not thy Love. I beg not of thee Gold, nor Silver, nor any other thing of the Creation; for all this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies me not without thee, and all is Poverty to me, without thy Love. It is Love I require, Love I beg of thee, Love I sue for, for thy Love I sigh; grant me thy Love, and I have enough.</p>
               <p n="3">3. O Lord, why dost thou delay this Mercy? Why seest thou me Day and Night in Pain, and dost not relieve me?<note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note>
                  <hi>How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? How long dost thou turn away thy Face from me? How long shall I put Counsels in my Soul; Sorrow in my Heart by Day?</hi> Regard and hear me, O Lord my God. I beg not the large Allowance that is given to Children, I will be content with any of the Crumbs that fall from thy Table.

The things of this World do not satisfie me, my God; thee alone I seek, thee alone I desire, thy Sight I require, and thy Love will I ever beg, and with thy Prophet will

               <p n="1">1. ALL the Motives and Reasons, my God, that induce me to love thee, oblige me also to place all my Hope in thee. For in whom shall I hope but in him that so entirely loves me? In him that has done me so much Good? In him that has suffered so much for me? In him that so often has call'd me, stay'd for me, born with me, forgiven and delivered me from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evils? In whom shall I hope but in him who is infinitely Merciful, Compassionate, Loving, Meek, Patient, and full of Forgiveness? In whom shall I hope, but in him who is my Father, an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Father; a Father to love me, and mighty to relieve me; a Father to cherish me, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do me Good; who is more Careful and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident for his Spiritual Children, than any Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father for his? In fine, in whom shall I hope, but in him, who almost throughout Holy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154273:60"/> Scripture continually bids me to come to him, and hope in him, and for so doing, promises me Millions of Benefits and Favours, giving me as Earnest, his Truth and Word, the Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, the Torments for me endur'd, and his Blood shed to confirm this Truth? What then may I not hope from a God so truly Good, who so passionately lov'd me, that for me he took Flesh upon him, was Scourg'd, Affronted and Buffetted for me; finally, from a God, who Dy'd on a Cross for me, and confin'd himself to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Host for me? How can he fly from me, when I seek him, who thus sought me, when I fled from him? How can he refuse me Pardon, when I beg, who earn'd it for me, when I did not ask it? How can he deny me Relief, now it costs him nothing, who purchas'd it for me, when it costs him so dear? For all these Reasons then will I confidently hope in him, and in the midst of all my Wants and Afflictions, with the Holy Prophet will I manfully sing,<note place="margin">Psal. 26.</note>
                  <hi>Our Lord is my Illumination, and my Salvation; whom shall I fear? Our Lord is the Protector of my Life; of whom shall I be afraid? If Camps stand together against me, my Heart shall not fear. If Battel rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, in him will I hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But because Hope is not safe without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, according to the Saying of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Sacrifice a Sacrifice of Justice, and hope in the Lord: Grant therefore, my God, that to the Hope of thy Mercy I may join Obedience to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, since this Obedience is no less due to thee from me than all the rest; for thou art my King, my Lord, and my Emperor; whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, the Sea, and all other Creatures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; whose Commands and Laws they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

May I obey thee, my King, and my Lord, and fully keep thy most Holy Laws. Reign thou in me, O Lord▪ and let not the World, nor the Prince of this World, nor my Flesh, nor my own Will, but thine reign in me. Far be from me all these Tyrants, these U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers of thy Seat, these Robbers of thy Glory, and Perverters of thy Justice, and do thou alone, O Lord, rule and command, and may th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

O when shall I be deliver'd from these Tyrants! O when will no Voice but thine be heard in my Soul! O when will the Attempts and Force of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries be so weakned, that there may be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance in me for fulfilling of thy Holy Will!

Grant me, O Lord, this Obedience, or rather, give me this Sovereignty over my Heart, that it may be so obedient to me, that I may be able wholly to subject it to thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as I am oblig'd to obey thee, so am I also to deliver and offer my self up to thee, and to resign my self into thy Hands, since I am whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thine, and thine on so many and so just Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.

Thine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154273:61"/> thou brought'st me out of Slavery, and bought'st me; not with Silver or Gold, but with thy Blood: And thine, because thou hast Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd me as often as thou hast brought me out of Sin. Then, if on so many Accounts I am thine, and if on so many Accounts thou art my King, my Lord, my Redeemer, my Deliverer, here I now deliver up to thee thy own, that is, my self; here I offer up my self for thy Captive and Slave; here I deliver to thee the Keys and Fortress of my Will, that from hence forward it may not be mine, nor any others but thine; that I may not live for my self, but thee; nor any more do my own Will, but thine, so that I may neither Eat, Drink, Sleep, nor do any thing but what is agreeable to thee, and tends to thy Service.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here I deliver up my self to thee, that thou may'st dispose of me, as of thy own, according to thy VVill. If thou wilt have me Live, Die, enjoy Health, endure Sickness, be Rich, be Poor, be Honour'd, be Disgrac'd, I wholly resign my self up into thy Hands, and Renounce my self, that I may no longer be my own, but thine; that what is thine of Right, may also be thine by my free Consent, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen. Pater Noster. Ave Maria.</hi>

                  <hi>and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</hi> So likewise by thy Prophet didst thou encourage us to the same, saying, <hi>Be converted to me,</hi>

                  <hi>and ye shall be saved, all ye ends of the Earth.</hi> If then thou, O Lord, dost call us thy self, if thou dost invite us, and open thy Arms to receive us, why shall not we confide; thou wilt admit us into them? Thou, O Lord, art not like Men that grow poor by giving, and therefore are offended to be ask'd. It is not so with thee; for as thou art not the poorer by giving, so thou growest not weary of being ask d. Therefore to beg Mercy of thee is not to importune, but to obey thee, since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hou command'st us to ask of thee, and it is to honour and glorifie thee, for hereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that thou art God, and Universal Lord, and Giver of all things, of whom all things are to be ask'd, since thou alone canst give all. Therefore thou requirest of us this sort of Sacrifice, saying, <hi>Invocate me in the Day of Tribulation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note>
                  <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, awaked by this pitiful Call, do come to thee, and beg that thou give me all that I owe thee; that is, that I may so adore thee, so fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence thee, so praise and thank thee for all thy Benefits, so love thee with all my Heart, so place all my Hope in thee, so obey thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so offer and resign my self up to thee, and so ask these and other Mercies of thee, as may conduce to thy Glory, and my own Salvation. I also beg, O Lord, thou wilt grant me Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Sins, true Contrition, and a Sincere Confession of them all, and that thou wilt assist
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154273:62"/> me with thy Grace, to the end I may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never offend thee: But particularly I beg of thee Strength to mortifie my Flesh, bridle my Tongue, subdue my Appetites, and recollect my Thoughts; that being thus renew'd and reform'd, I may deserve to be thy living Temple, and Place of Abode. Grant me likewise all those Virtues, wherewith this thy Dwelling may not only be cleans'd, but also adorn'd; that is, profound Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, perfect Patience, clear Discretion, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit, Fortitude and Diligence in all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for thy Service, and above all, a most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Charity towards my Neighbours, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But because I deserve not any part hereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, thy Mercy, which often takes place only in regard to our Miseries.<note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Remember that thou desirest not the Death of the Sinner,</hi> (as thou saidst thy self) <hi>but that he be converted, and live. Remember that thy only begotten Son came not to this World</hi> (as he says) <hi>to seek Just Men, but Sinners.</hi> Remember all he did in this World, and all he endur'd, from the Day of his Birth, till he expir'd on the Cross, since he suffer'd no part thereof for himself, but for me; all which I offer up as a Sacrifice for my Sins and Wants; and this Mercy I beg for his sake, and not for mine. For since of thee it is said, that thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'st the Fathers in the Sons, bestowing thy Mercies on the one for the sake of the other (as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Mephiboseth,</hi> for the sake of his Father <hi>Jonathan</hi>) honour therefore thy only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, doing Good to me for his sake, since he is my Father, and my Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and I his Son, tho' a wicked one. Remember, O Lord, that I have recourse to thee; that I fly to thee,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154273:62"/> and, as to a true Physician and Lord, lay before thee my Wants and Wounds, and in this Spirit I will call upon thee with the Prayer of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> saying,</p>

Because thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild; and of much Mercy to all that invocate thee. Receive, O Lord, my Prayer with thine Ears, and attend to the Voice of my Petition. In the Day of my Tribulation I have call'd to thee; because thou hast heard me. There is not like to thee amongst Gods, O Lord; and there is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Works. All Nations, whatsoever thou hast made shall come, and shall adore before thee, O Lord, and they shall glorifie thy Name. Because thou art great, and doing marvellous things; thou only art God. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy Way, and I will walk in thy Truth; let my Heart rejoice, that it may fear thy Name. I will confess to thee, O Lord, my God, with all my Heart; and will glorifie thy Name for ever.</hi> Amen. <hi>Pater Noster. Ave Maria.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Here follows a very devout Prayer, to be said in the Morning; wherein, after laying down on how many Accounts, and for what great Benefits Man is Debtor to God, he offers on his part what he can; that is, returns hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thanks to him for his Benefits, offers up himself to God, and begs his Grace.</head>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 62.</note>1. O <hi>God, my God, to thee I watch from the Morning Light,</hi> saith the Holy King <hi>David</hi> in one of his <hi>Psalms;</hi> and a little below, <hi>If I have been mindful of thee upon my Bed, in the Morning I will meditate on thee; because thou hast been my Helper.</hi> I also, O Lord my God, will with this Holy King, watch to thee in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let this be the first of my Cares, the first of my Thoughts, since it is the Principal Duty, and the End for which I was Created, and for which things were Created, which is to Praise, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and Magnifie thy Holy Name. Because thou, O Lord, art the Beginning and End of all things, a Beginning without a Beginning, and an End without an End. For as none could Create them without thee, so could they be Created for none but thee; that is, that they might all serve, praise, and declare thy Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou art the Universal Giver of all that is good, since there is no Gift of Nature, or Grace, of the Body, or Soul, which originally doth not spring from thee, who art the Universal Source of all Goodness. Thou art an Ocean of all Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, an Abyss of Grandeur, a Sea of Infinite
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154273:63"/> Goodness and Mercy, and a Mirror of Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Beauty. Thou art the God of Gods, the Holy of Holies, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the Cause of Causes, the Being of Beings, the Life of the Living, the Order of the Universe, the Beauty of the World, and the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou art my Creator, who out of nothing madest me to thy own Image and Likeness. Thou art my Preserver, who always supportest me, that I may not again fall to the same nothing. Thou art my Sanctifier, who liftest me up by thy Grace to a higher Being. And thou art my Glorifier, who createdst me for yet a better Being, which is that of Glory. Thou to this End art my Exciter, my Helper, my Defender, my Preserver, my Pastor, my Benefactor, my King, my Lord, my Father, my Spouse, the Center of my Soul, and my Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End, in whom alone is all my Felicity and Happiness, and the whole Perfection of all my Life. All this thou art to me, O Lord, as thou art God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as Man, thou art my Redeemer, my Saviour, my Deliverer, and (as thy Apostle saith) <hi>Thou art my Wisdom, my Justice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note>
                  <hi>my Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my Redemption, my Sacrifice, my Lamb, my Priest, my Mediator, my Intercessor, my Pastor, my Master, my Example, my Strength, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the Universal Physician of all my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;</hi> for thou didst Cure my Pride with thy Humility, my Avarice with thy Poverty, my Pleasures with thy Pains, my Anger with thy Mildness, my Envy with thy Charity, my Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Vinegar and Gall thou drank'st for me, and my Sloth with the vast Labours thou underwent'st for me. For me thou didst Fast,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154273:64"/> Travel, Sweat, Watch, Pray, and Weep, and wast Banish'd, Persecuted, Spit upon, Defam'd, Scourg'd, Crown'd, Crucify'd, and Afflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Men in the World.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All these are Benefits of thine, and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heap'd on me, and Ties that make me all thine, and Fetters that render me thy Prisoner and Captive. What then can I give thee, O Lord, for all these Benefits? How can I requite so many, and so great Bounties? For certain it is, that had I the Hearts of all Men, and did love thee with them all, yet could I not make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for any one of these Obligations. How then shall I, my God, answer so many? How shall I deny thee one only Heart I have for them all, since I owe thee so much for every one? What then shall I do, my God; what shall I do? I can do no more but render thee Infinite Thanks for the Multitude of these Benefits, and beg of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Earth and Heaven, that they help me to praise and give thee those Thanks, which I alone of my self cannot worthily give thee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call upon them with the <hi>Canticle,</hi> sung to thee by the Three Youths in the Furnace of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>

                  <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of certain Reasons, which oblige Man to serve God; and he doing what is in him, offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to that Purpose, and begs his Grace.</head>
                  <p n="7">7. NEither are these Blessings and Praises all that I owe thee, since I am all thine, and thine on so many and so just Accounts. A Man sometimes buys another in <hi>Guinea</hi> for an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Trifle, and that Man bought for so base a Price, remains so much a Slave to him that bought him, that he has not an Hour to dispose of, nor a Penny he can call his own. And when the Buyer pleases, he locks him up in a House, or in a Dungeon, and if he pleases, there Scourges and Chastises him, and does all to him that his Will dictates. Now, if I, my Lord and God, am thine, on so many Accounts; thine, because thou didst Create me, because thou didst Purchase me with thy Blood, and because every Moment of my Life thou art continually preserving me in such sort, that I cannot open my Mouth, move my Tongue, or stir Hand or Foot without thee; if on so many Accounts I am thine, how can I exempt my self from thy Service? How shall I deny thee what is thine? How can I be Lord of my self to live after my own Will, when as I am thine on so many Accounts? Confessing therefore, O Lord, most humbly this mighty Obligation; from henceforward I deliver up, and offer my self for thy Eternal Slave, and consequently tender thee all that this Day, and all my Life time I shall Think, Do, Say, Suffer, Eat, Drink, Sleep, and all other Things; that it may all tend to thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154273:65"/> and Praise. And over and above all I offer up my self, that I may be no longer my own, but thine, nor live to my self, nor labour for my self, nor seek my self, but in all things, and at all times, seek to serve thee, and fulfil thy Divine Will; so that as often as I do the contrary, I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my self a Thief, and Usurper of another's Right, since I wrongfully withdraw the Service and Obedience which on so many Accounts is due to thee, my God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But because without thy Grace I cannot pay this great Debt, I beg of thee, my God, that thou wilt assist me therein, and create in me a new Heart, which may think no Hour its own, but what it employs in thy Love, and a new Will, which may desire nothing but to fulfil thine, and an Understanding, and Memory, that may never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee. Grant also, O Lord, that I may bridle my Tongue, watch my Eyes, cleanse my Heart, chastise my Flesh, and mortifie all my Appetites and Inclinations. Grant me most profound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Heart, Patience, Obedience, Meekness, Purity of Intention, true Discretion, Poverty of Spirit, Zeal of thy Honour, Love and Tenderness towards my Neighbours, and a Sincere Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Sufferings.

                  <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> An Advertisement in Relation to this Prayer.</head>
                  <p n="9">9. IT is not requisite, Christian Reader, that this Prayer be always so repeated Word for Word, as set down here, but a Man ought to comprehend its Parts and Energy, and to practice
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154273:65"/> it in his Heart with such Words as his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall suggest. For by this means it will be newer to him every Time, and will cause new Effects, and stir up fresh Devotion in his Heart. In order to which, let him consider that the Ground of this Prayer, is the Meditation of those Benefits and Graces for which we are so much indebted to our Lord. Which ought to be diligently consider'd as they occurr to the Memory, that so the Heart may be stirr'd up to the Love and Service of a Lord, to whom he is so much indebted. Which Debt if Man could once conceive as it is in it self, he would find himself so bound and oblig'd, that he might easily know how to prosecute the other three parts that follow, which are, the Thanksgiving, Offering and Petition. Then it may be extended much more at large than here it is, descending particularly to ask all such things as we stand in need of, for our Selves, and for all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and then at last we may insist as long as we please upon the final Petition, that is, the of God, which is the most Devout, and most Profitable of them all.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now this Advertisement is so much the more necessary, because this Prayer is proper to be us'd as soon as a Man Rises, which is often before Day; and if he exercise his Thoughts herein, he will need no Light to Pray by, but may in the Dark with more Recollection go over each particular part of this Exercise. When he repeats the Canticle of the Three Young Men, let him observe, that after every half Verse, the Scripture repeats these Words, Praise and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-exalt him for ever. VVhich Words carry great Force and Devotion for a Heart that knows
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:154273:66"/> what it is to Love God. So that as often as they are repeated, so often is the Heart pierced. If he be not inclined to go through the whole Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, it will be enough to say half of it. But if he require more than the Song contains, he may run through all the Quires of Angels, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confessors, Virgins and Widows. And let him beg of them all, to assist him to Praise and Glorifie their Common Lord, repeating with each of them those Words, Praise and Super-exalt him for ever.</p>

               <p>O Almighty, All-Merciful, and Compassionate Father, Prostrate at thy Feet I most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinner do Confess my Great Crimes with which I have offended thee, my most Tender Father. I also confess my Great Ingratitude to thy Infinite Benefits, that is, to so much Love and Goodness as thou hast us'd towards me, giving me so much Time to do Penance, not Casting me into Hell as my Malice had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, but rather Exciting and Inviting me with thy Grace. O how often, my God, hast thou Call'd upon my Soul by means of thy Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations? How often hast thou Stirr'd me up with thy Benefits? How often hast thou Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress'd with me with Favours? How often hast thou Chastis'd me with Stripes? Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154273:66"/> all this, I still cast thee, from me and turn'd my Back upon thee, whilst thou with Wonderful Patience still didst bear with me. O how justly mightest thou have cast me into the deepest Pit of Hell, and only of thy Mercy didst stay the stroke of thy Indignation, which I had so well deserv'd. It is Wonderful, O most Sweet Father, that my Heart does not burst with Sorrow when I consider these things. I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be call'd thy Creature, to live upon Earth, or to receive my Sustenance from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is wonderful that all Creatures have not reveng'd the Wrongs and Affronts I have offer'd thee. Yet nevertheless, most Merciful Father, have Pity on me, and receive me into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of thy Infinite Clemency. Forgive me that I so long delay'd my Conversion. Admit me to that most Meek Fatherly Bosom, and give me the Sustenance thou usest to afford thy Children. I beg of thee, O Lord, to produce that in me now for which thou hast so long expected me. I frankly confess, I am the most Vicious of all Vicious Men in the World, but yet I confide in thy Goodness. For tho' my Sins be Numberless, so also is the Multitude of thy Mercies.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> O most Loving Father, if you please, thou canst Cleanse me.

                  <hi>yet return to Me, and I will receive thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore, most Merciful Father, relying on this Promise, I turn to thee with all my Heart, as if thou had'st only Call'd and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me by those Loving Words. For I am that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154273:67"/> Miserable and Rebellious Creature, that Wild and Prodigal Son who fled from the Father of Light,<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> of whom proceeds all Good; and like a stray Sheep I wander'd from thy Flock, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Graces thou hadst bestow'd on me. I left thee the Fountain of Living Waters,<note place="margin">Hier. 2.</note> and was to Drink of the Salt Wells of Bitter Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which are soon Drein'd; for certain it is, that all Sensual Delights vanish like Smoke.

I forsook thee the most Supream and Perfect Good, and ran after the Earthly Fading Goods, and was lost among them.

               <p n="4">4. And thou most Sacred Son, my Saviour, and my Lord, have Mercy upon me.

Give me the Grace, O Lord, that I may so serve thee my Creator and Heavenly Father, that all my Passions and Vicious Inclinations being Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd, I may restore in me the Image thou didst Create, and become like to thee in Innocence of Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I give thee Thanks for the Benefit of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; because thou who Createdst me, art always Preserving me in this Being which thou gav'st me, and because to this intent thou Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedst all the things in this World, the Heaven, Earth, Sea, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Beasts, Fishes, Fowl, the Trees, and all other Creatures, whereof some thou mad'st to Maintain me, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Heal me, others to Delight me, others to Instruct me, and others also to Chastise me. I beseech thee, O Lord, that I may know how
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154273:68"/> to make use of all these things, and make my Advantage of them to that End they were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that is, thatt hrough them I may attain to a True Knowledge of thee my True God and Lord, and by them my Heart may be Inflam'd with Love and Admiration of thy Holy Name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I give thee Thanks, Sweet Jesus, for the Benefit of my Redemption; that is, for that incomprehensible Goodness and Mercy which thou didst use towards me, and for that most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Charity, wherewith thou Redeemest me, descending upon Earth, to lift us up to Heaven, making thy self Man, to make us Gods, and suffering a cruel Death, to give us true Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I give thee Thanks for the Humility of thy Incorruption, for the Poverty of the Birth, for the Bloodshed at thy Circumcision, for thy Banishment into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for thy Fasting in the Desart, for thy Watching in Prayer, for thy Weariness in Travel, and for the Poverty and Humility of thy most Holy Life. I give thee Thanks for all the Pains and Disgraces thou for me didst undergo, in thy most Dolorous and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Death. I give thee Thanks for thy Prayer in the Garden, for thy Bloody Sweat, for thy Apprehending, for the Buffets, Blasphemies, and Scourges, thou enduredst; for thy Crown of Thorns, for thy Purple-Garment, for the Scoffs and Contempts put upon thee, for the Vinegar and Gall given thee to Drink, for the Nails that Pierced thee, for thy Death and Cross, since thou didst ordain and endure all this for my Salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I give thee Thanks, Sweet Jesus, who from my Birth, and Beginning of my Life, didst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into the Bosom of thy Church, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154273:68"/> brought'st me up in the Catholick Faith, mad'st me a Christian, and till this Day hast Preserv'd and Maintain'd my Soul and Body. May it please thy Goodness, that thou alone mayst be the Delightful Food of my Heart, and that my Soul may ever Thirst only after thee the Fountain of Life, till having ended the Course of this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, I may enjoy the Bliss of that River of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which flows from thee the Fountain of Life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I give thee Thanks, Sweet Jesus, who till this time, without my Knowledge, hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd me from many and great Dangers of Body and Soul, tho' I, through my great and continual Wickedness, have often deserv'd to be forsaken.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I give thee Thanks for that when I lay wallowing in the Filth of my Vices, thou didst bear with me so patiently, and gav'st me Time to Repent, tho' I have so often offended Thee, and withstood thy Holy Inspirations. Grant, O Lord, that from henceforward I may follow Thee with humble Affection, and that I obediently and readily embrace thy Holy Inspirations, and cast from my Heart the Love of all visible Things, that it may be wholly employ'd in thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever swerving from thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I give thee Thanks, O Lord, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these Benefits, thou hast for my Good Instituted such Wonderful Sacraments, because thou dost Visit me with such Holy Inspirations, and for the Glory of Heaven, which thou hast in store for me, if I through my own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness render not my self incapable of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. These, O Lord, are the common Benefits that I know of; there are doubtless many more of which I am Ignorant, yet for which I own no less Thanks than for those here mention'd,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154273:69"/> but rather the greater, because this demonstrates the Excess of thy Goodness, since while I slept thou didst watch to defend me from a thousand Dangers, and do me many Favours. Wherefore, as I am oblig'd to beg Pardon of thee, not only for the Sins I know of, but also for those I know not, even so am I oblig'd to give thee what Thanks I can, not only for thy Benefits within my Knowledge, but also for those I know not of; and therefore I Adore, Praise, and Bless thee for them all. Grant then, O Lord, that I may so use these Benefits, that they may not produce in me any Pride or Neglect, but rather Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gratitude, and a desire to serve thee. Thou who livest and reignest for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Alas, how ill have I requited so Bountiful and Charitable a Benefactor! I was ever ungrateful to thy Benefits, and always obstructed thy Inspirations, adding Sins to Sins, and Crimes to Crimes. I confess, O Lord, I deserve not the Name of thy Son, and yet I acknowledge thee for my Father. For thou art truly my Father
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154273:69"/> and all my Hope; thou art the Fountain of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who despisest not the foul Sinners that run to thee, but rather dost cleanse and ease them. Behold then, my only Refuge, how I, the poorest of all Creatures, come to thee, bringing nothing along with me but the Burden of my Sins, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prostrate my self at the Feet of thy Goodness, and beg Mercy; forgive me, my Surest Hope, and save me for thy Infinite Clemency.</p>
               <p>O most Sweet Jesus, in Satisfaction for all my Sins, I offer thee that wonderful Charity which mov'd thee, the God of Infinite Majesty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man for us, and to live in this World 33 Years, with many Labours, Afflictions, Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Contradictions, Troubles and Fatigues. I offer thee that mortal Oppression of Spirit, that bloody Sweat, and that Agony which afflicted thee kneeling before thy Father in the Garden. I offer thee that Ardent Desire thou hast to suffer, when of thy own Accord thou didst deliver thy self up to thy Enemies, and offer thy self a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for us. I offer thee thy Imprisonment, Scourging, Buffetting, Reviling, Blaspheming, Spitting from the foul Mouths of thy Enemies, and all other sorts of Torments, which thou didst endure that Night in the House of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> for our sake. All this I offer up to thee, beseeching thy Infinite Goodness, that for these thy Merits thou forgive my Sins, purge my Soul, and carry it to Eternal Life.</p>

I also offer thee that unspeakable Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Patience, wherewith thou borest thy Crowning with Thorns, thy Cloathing with Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scorn, and the despiteful Saluting, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon, and Striking thee with the Reed thou held'st in thy Hand. I offer thee that painful
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154273:70"/> Weariness of thy Sacred Body, that tiresome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and the heavy Burden of the Cross, which thou carriedst on thy tender and weari'd Shoulders. I offer thee the Sweat and Thirst thou enduredst on the Cross, with many other Pains thou sufferedst; all this I offer thee with the most hearty Thanks I can, beseeching thy Immense Goodness, that thro' these Merits thou Pardon my Sins, Purifie my Soul, and carry it to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. O Sweet Jesus, in Satisfaction for all my Sins, I offer thee the most cruel Pains thou didst endure, when taking off thy Garment which clung to thy Back, all the Wounds of thy Scourges were renew'd, when thy Holy Feet and Hands were nail d to the Cross, when thy Limbs were disjointed, when thy Precious Blood flow'd from thy Wounds like the Streams from the Fountain. I offer thee every Drop of that Precious Blood, I offer thee the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Meekness, wherewith thou didst suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Contradiction and Scorn of those Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who shaking their Heads, Scoff'd at thee, whilst thou mercifully didst Excuse and Pray for them. I also offer thee the Incomprehensible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that consum'd thee; when being wholly deliver'd up to the Violence of thy Sorrows, and forsaken of all Comfort, thou hung'st desolately on the Cross betwixt two Thieves. I offer thee the great Thirst thou wast sensible of, and that Humility and Reverence, wherewith letting fall thy Head, thou recommendedst thy Spirit to thy Father. I offer thee that saving Blood which gush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly from thy pierc'd and wounded Side. All this I offer, together with the Thanks I can give, beseeching thee that thro' these Merits thou forgive my Sins, purifie my Soul, and carry it

               <p n="1">1. MOST Benign, most Pitiful, and most Merciful Father, have Compassion on me. For my own, and for the Sins of all the World, I offer thee the Life, Passion and Death of thy only Begotten Son. I offer thee all he did and endur'd in this VVorld for our sake. I offer thee the Merits of his most Sacred Mother, and of all the Saints, that through them all thou may'st Pardon me, have Mercy on me, and grant me E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</p>

I beseech thee, O Lord, that thou wilt make me partake of thy Merits; that being incorporate with thee, and become the same thing with thee, thro' Love and Imitation of thy most Holy Life, I may deserve to enjoy thee, as the Branch does of the Vine; for thou art the true Vine and Life of all the Faithful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Holy Ghost, thou Comforter, assist me, my God, and my Lord. To thee I recommend my Soul and Body, and all that is mine. To thee I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154273:71"/> offer up the Remainder and End of my Life. Grant that I may end it in thy Service, doing true Penance for my Sins before I depart this Mortal Body. I who am blind and weak whilst I live in this World, am easily ensnar'd by my own Affections, easily drawn away, and easily deceived. Therefore it is I deliver my self up to thee, and put my self under thy Protection. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, O Lord, this thy wretched Servant from all Evil. Instruct and enlighten my Understanding, govern my Soul, rule my Body, and strengthen my Spirit against the Inordinate Weakness of my Heart. Give me solid Faith, assured Hope, and perfect Charity. Grant that I may sweetly love thee, and that at all Times, and in all Places, I may fulfil thy Holy Will.</p>

Before thy Divine Majesty I humbly prostrate my self, and irrevocably deliver my self up to thy Holy Will. Lord remove from me, and from all the Faithful, all that is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to thee, and grant us all that is acceptable in thy Sight, and make us such as thou would'st have us to be. I recommend to thee my Parents, Brethren, Kindred, Benefactors, Friends, and all those I am obliged to pray for. I recommend to thee all thy Church; grant that all may serve thee, all know thee, all love thee, and love one another. Reduce to the right way those that are gone astray, extirpate Heresies, and convert to the Faith all those who as yet have no Knowledge of thy Holy Name. Give us Peace, and continue us in it, as is agreeable with thy Holy Will, and for our Advantage. Relieve and comfort all that live in Sorrow, Temptation, Misfortunes, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154273:71"/> Afflictions, either Spiritual or Corporal. In fine, To thy sure Protection I recommend all thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that thou may'st grant Grace to the Living, and everlasting Rest to the Dead.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I salute thee, brightest Beautiful Lilly, and Delightful Spring, most Blessed Virgin. I salute thee, most fragrant Violet of Divine Sweetness.

Direct thou my Life, that I may have the Knowledge, Will and Power, to do always that which is most pleasing to thee, and most expedient for my own Soul. Let my Way, O Lord, to thee be Sure, Strait and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that neither Adversity make me faint, nor Prosperity fall away from thee; that I be not puff'd up with Pride by the one, nor driven down into Despair by the other, but that in the one I may give thee Thanks, and in the other be arm'd with Patience, that I may rejoice in nothing but what brings me nearer to thee, my Blessed Jesus, nor grieve at any thing, but that which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws me from thee.

That all Transitory Things may for thy sake be of no Account with me, and that whatever is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy Will may be delightful to mine. And especially that thou, O my God, may'st be pleasing to me above all things; that I may have no Joy besides thee, nor Desire of any thing but thee. Let all Labour delight me, that is taken for thee, and all Ease be unpleasant to me, which is without thee. Make me lift up my Heart often to thee; and lest I should forget my self, give

               <p n="1">1. MOst Merciful and Supream Creator of Heaven and Earth, I the vilest of all Sinners, jointly with the Church do offer up to thee this most Precious Sacrifice, (which is thy only Begotten Son) for all the Sins I have committed, and for all the Benefits I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from thee. Behold, most Merciful King, him that suffers, and Graciously remember him he suffers for. Is not this He whom thou deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed st up to Death, for Redemption of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154273:74"/> Slave? Is not this the Author of Life, who being carry'd like a Sheep to the Slaughter, did not refuse to suffer such a Cruel Death? Cast thy Eyes, O my Lord God, on this Work of unspeakable Mercy! Behold the Sweet Jesus stretch d out on the Cross, and his Innocent Hands running Blood, and be pleased to forgive the Crimes committed by mine. Look upon his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Breast cruelly pierc'd with a Spear, and wash me in the holy Flood that gush'd thence. View those Sacred Feet, (which never walk'd in the ways of Sinners) struck through with Nails, and be pleas'd to guide mine in the way of thy Commandments. I beseech thee, O King of Kings, for the sake of this Holy of Holies, for the sake of this my Redeemer, that I may be united to him in Spirit, since he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd not to be join'd to me in Flesh. Behold, most Merciful Father, thy most Loving Son's Head hanging down, his Neck bow'd, and fallen at the approach of Death. See, most Merciful Creator, the torn Body of thy Beloved Son, and have Pity on thy Servant Redeem'd. Look upon his Naked Body, how Wan it appears, how Bloody his Breast, how his Wither'd Bowels are extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how his Beautiful Eyes are sunk, how Pale is his Noble Countenance, how Lank are his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Arms, how his Beautiful Knees hang, and how his Pierced Feet are Bath'd with Streams of Blood. View the torn Limbs, most Glorious Father, of thy most Loving Son, and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Misery of thy most Vile Servant. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Pains of the Redeemer, and Pardon the Crimes of the Redeemed. This, O Merciful Father, is our Faithful Advocate before thee. This is that High Priest, who stands not in need
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:154273:74"/> to be sanctified with any other Blood, since he appears sprinkled with his own. This is the Holy, Acceptable and Perfect Sacrifice, offer'd and receiv'd in the Odour of Sweetness. This is the Lamb without Spot, that was Dumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that shore him; who being wounded with Stripes, sully'd with Spittle, and revil'd with Scoffs, did not open his Mouth. This is he who having committed no Sins, suffer'd for our Sins, and heal'd our Wounds with his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What didst thou, most Sweet Jesus, to be so judg'd? What didst thou commit, most Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lamb, to be so treated? What were thy Crimes, and the Cause of thy Condemnation? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, O Lord, I am the Cause of thy Sorrow, the Occasion of thy Death, and the Motive of thy Condemnation. O wonderful Providence of God! The wicked Man sins, and the just is punish'd; the guilty Man offends, and the innocent is wounded, and the Lord suffers for what his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants committed. How low, O Son of God, how low did thy Humility descend? How far did thy Charity extend? How far did thy Love stretch it self? How far has thy Mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd? I committed the Crime, and thou suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the Punishment; I committed the Sins, and thou takest upon thee the Penalty; I grew proud, and thou art humbl'd; I was disobedient, and thou becomest obedient, even unto Death, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone for my Disobedience. Behold, O King of Glory, thy Goodness, and my Impiety; thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and my Iniquity. See here, O Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherefore thou should'st have Mercy on me, since I have devoutly offer'd thee the most Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all Offerings. I have presented to thee thy most Loving Son, and placed this Faithful Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:154273:75"/> betwixt thee and me; look upon lovingly the good Shepherd, and turn not thy Eyes from the stray Sheep he brings upon his Shoulders.

               <p n="1">1. I Adore, Praise, and Glorifie thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, I bless and give thee Thanks, O Son of the Living God, because thou wouldst that for my sake thy most Sacred Limbs should so many ways be mangled and tortur'd. I salute them all one by one to thy Honour, and for thy Love. I salute the Feet of my Lord, for my sake tir'd, batter'd and pierc'd with Nails. I salute the venerable Knees, so often bent on the Ground for me, and so often weari'd with Travelling. I salute the heavenly Breast, for me deform'd with Blood and Scars. I salute the most sacred Side, for me wounded with a Spear. I salute the most lovely, sweet and merciful Heart, for me struck through. I salute the most tender Back, for me scourg'd, and gushing Blood. I salute the most amiable Arms, for me stretch'd out and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I salute the most tender Hands, for me wounded and struck through with Nails. I salute the most beautiful Shoulders, for me oppress'd and bruis'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154273:75"/> with the weight of the Cross. I salute the most sweet Mouth and Throat, for me embittered with Vinegar and Gall. I salute the most favourable Ears, for me affronted with Scoffs and Revilings. I salute the blessed Eyes, water'd with Tears for my Sins. I salute the venerable Head, for me crown'd with Thorns, wounded and beaten with the Cane. Most Merciful Jesus, I salute all thy Precious Body, for me scourg'd, wounded, crucify'd, dead, and bury'd. I salute the most Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood shed and offer'd up for me. I salute thee, most noble Soul, for me afflicted and oppress'd with Sorrow. Most loving Lord, I beseech thee, for the sake of thy most holy Limbs, that thou san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie mine, and wash off all the Stains I have put upon them, making ill use of them all. Thou who livest and reignest for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The First Prayer upon the Life of our Blessed Lady.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAil most Sweet Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom God chose for his Mother from all Eternity. Thou art that blessed Female, of whom the King of Heaven and Earth would take Flesh to redeem
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154273:76"/> Mankind. Thou art that Holy Mediatrix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, by whose Means Heaven and Earth, and the higher and lower things were join'd. Thou art the Guide of our Life, the Gate to Divine Mercy, and the Port of this stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my World. Obtain for me, O Blessed Virgin, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of my Sins, and Grace, that I may with my utmost Endeavours Love and Honour thy Son, my Redeemer, and the Mother of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hail Sweet Virgin, whom the Ancient Fathers earnestly wish'd for, represented by many Figures, and promis'd in many Prophesies and Revelations. Receive me, Blessed Virgin, for thy Servant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt me, Mother of Grace, and grant that I may be in the number of those thou lovest, and whose Names are writ in thy Sacred Bosom, whom thou instructest, directest, and defendest upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hail Sweet Virgin, wonderfully beautify'd by God in thy Mother's Womb, and adorn'd with all Perfections and Graces. O most Bright, most Resplendent, and most Pure Virgin, chosen from among Thousands, despise me not, tho' I be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, as thou knowest, but rather give Ear to this miserable Creature calling upon thee, relieve this poor Wretch who seeks thee, and assist him who places all his Trust in thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> whose Birth expected so many Ages, and so wish'd for by Nations, rejoic'd the World with new Light and Pleasure. O most Innocent Virgin, cause me to become Innocent, and put from me all that in me is displeasing in thy Sight. Have pity on me, since from thy Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, thro' the whole Course of thy Life, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion grew in thee.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:154273:76"/>5. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> on whom God bestow'd all Corporal Beauty, and all Spiritual Grace, which render'd thee Amiable to all Nations. O most Graceful Virgin adorn, I beseech thee, my Soul with Spiritual Ornaments, fix in my Heart lively Affection of Purity and Chastity, that so I may please thee in all things, and may become thy true Imitater and Servant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hail Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> whom thy Pious Parents brought to the Temple and presented to the Lord, where thou didst lead an Angelical Life, all Godly, all Meek, all Sweet, and all Pleasing to our Lord. Grant that I may perceive the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of thy most Holy Conversation, that as far as in me is, I may be burdensome to no Body, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize no Body, or offend no Body, but rather comfort all, and excite all to the Love of God, and Contempt of this World.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> Leader, and Purest of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who wholly consecrating thy self to God, didst freely and deliberately make a Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity. Thou art the perfect Pattern of true Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chastity, whose most Chaste and most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation pierc'd the Hearts of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held thee with Heavenly Light, and bred in them the Love of Continency and Purity. Obtain for me, O Blessed Virgin, true Purity of Soul and Body, so that no Foulness may defile me, no Vice take Root in me, and I may consent to no World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pleasure; but that despising all the Delights and Desires of the Flesh, all my Repose and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction may be in only thy Blessed Son.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> whom God, amidst thy Holy Studies and Contemplations, comforted with the familiar Ministry of Angels, and with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Joy, proceeding from the Purity of thy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154273:77"/> Conscience. Obtain for me, thro' thy Merits, the Love of Solitude, and of reposing and employing my self in Holy Prayers, Pious Reading, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual Exercises, with all Sincerity and Quiet of my Soul, and that these may be my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights all the time I shall be detain'd in the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prison of this Body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who being a Virgin, wast by Divine Providence betroath'd to the pure unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Joseph.</hi> Suffer me not to stray from thee, but always look upon me with Eyes of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for as he whom thou beholdest with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot live for ever, so neither can he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for ever, whom thou mercifully regardest. Receive, blessed Virgin, the Soul that loves thee, and preserve him that confides in thee. Be always compassionate towards me, that through thee I may find Grace in the Sight of him that chose thee.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> whom in the depth of profound Contemplation, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy private Retreat, and there communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to thee the Mysteries of Divine Providence. O that all my Delight were often to salute thee, and do thee Devout Service! O that there were nothing in me that might offend thy Sight, which is purer than that of the Angels!</p>
               <p n="11">11. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who in thy most Chaste Womb didst conceive the Son of God. O most happy of all Women, give me to understand what Joy fill'd thy Heart at that time, and what Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness diffused it self through thy Blessed Soul, when that Spring of Living Waters, and Fountain of all Sweetness, enter'd thy most Holy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and was cloath'd with thy most Pure Flesh. O Glorious Virgin, I humbly Praise, Glorifie and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154273:77"/> worship thy most Holy Virgin Bowels, and be thou pleased ever to preserve and augment in my Soul the Gift of Purity and Chastity.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who carrying the King of Glory in thy Womb, didst ascend the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Jury,</hi> and visit and attend thy Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Blessed Saint <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Visit, O Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Virgin, my Soul, and grant that all the Days of my Life I may serve thee most devoutly, and love thee from the Bottom of my Heart. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. HAil Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who being a Tender Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and big with Child, didst travel with thy Holy Spouse St. <hi>Joseph</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> there to pay the common Tribute. Give me the Grace pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to bear the Miseries of this Banishment, and ever aspire to the Heavenly <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where is the Bread of Life, Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who being weary with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling when thou cam'st to the City, didst find no Lodging, and therefore didst take up with a Stable to rest in, and bring forth the King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Govern, O Holy Virgin, all the Affections of my Soul, that I may love nothing inordinately, nor be led away by any, but that, as a Stranger and Pilgrim in this World, all my Wishes may tend to the Heavenly Dwelling, and rest only in God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154273:78"/>3. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who without any Pain, or the least Detriment to thy pure Virginity, didst bring forth the Saviour of the World, and Joy of Heaven. Thou art at once a Virgin, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou the Temple of the true <hi>Solomon;</hi> thou the Ark and Tabernacle of God; thou the closed Door which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw; thou the Garden, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, and sealed Fountain of the Heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. Fill, O Blessed Virgin, my Heart, and all my Senses, with thy Grace; that being strengthned with this Support, I may lead a Life pleasing to thy Son and thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who didst wrap up Jesus, the Fruit of thy most pure Womb, in poor Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Bands, and laid him in a Manger. O that thy Love might so wholly take up my Heart, and the Purity of thy Life so beautifie my Soul, that I might become as a new-born Babe, to the end, in any Affliction I might deserve to be assisted by thee, and to be reliev'd with thy Benefits.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who didst suckle the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Jesus at thy Virgin Breasts, and sweetly hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in thy Arms, didst humbly kiss and adore him. Grant, O Blessed Virgin, that when I come tir'd from the Troubles and Miseries of this Life, I may have Recourse to thy Motherly Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being recreated by thee with the Milk of Spiritual Consolation, may despise all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this fading World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who after 40 Days didst present thy Babe in the Temple, where the Holy <hi>Simeon</hi> receiv'd him into his Arms, and sang that sweet Canticle, tho' afterwards he mix'd his Notes with Tears, foretelling the many Sufferings and Persecutions that were pre-ordain'd for that Holy Child, and the Multitude of Sorrow that was to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:154273:78"/> pierce thy Heart. I beg of thee, O Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that I may imitate this Long-suffering and Patience, embracing all the Troubles our Lord shall afflict me with, and by this Example ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the great Goodness he shows me.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="8">8. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who coming to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with thy Son Jesus, then Twelve Years of age, didst lose him without the least Fault on thy Side, didst seek him with great Grief and Care, and didst find him in the Temple disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Doctors to thy unspeakable Joy. Grant, Blessed Virgin, that whensoever through my own Fault I lose the Grace of Devotion, I may seek it again with like Earnestness, and may consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find it; and after finding, may be more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over it, that so I may ever be the more ready for all that belongs to the Service of my Creator.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

Grant me that I may ever praise that Lord for all he did and endur'd for me, and that for his sake I may pity all that are in Affliction and Trouble.</p>
               <p>Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> whose Blessed Soul was pierc'd with Grief, when thou stood'st, full of Tears, at the Foot of the Cross, with tender Eyes, beholding the Wounds and the Blood of thy suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Son. Grant me, Blessed Virgin, that I may constantly persevere with thee at the Foot of the Cross, and with a Devout Heart bewail the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of thy only Son, my Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hail Sweet <hi>Mary,</hi> who, standing in that Place, didst hear those doleful Words from the Mouth of thy most Holy Son, saying, <hi>Woman, behold thy Son.</hi> In this manner, recommending thee to the Beloved Disciple, during his own Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, providing him a Mother, and thee a Son, in his Place. Thou also hearedst him say, He was Thirsty, and yet was it not allow'd thee to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154273:79"/> give a little Water to thy Son, who ask'd it at his Death, but instead of it, sawest them give him Vinegar. Thou also beheld'st that Son thou so entirely didst love, expire, and then his Breast, pierced with a Spear, which Wound he felt not, as being Dead, but it troubl'd thy Pure and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Heart; which, tho' Dead to the World, was still more than Alive to what concern'd thy Beloved Son. I beg of thee, most Holy Virgin, by all these Excessive Sorrows, that thou wilt be pleas'd to pierce my Heart wirh Compassion and Remembrance of all the Pains my Redeemer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd for me, and make me Partaker of the Benefit thereof, that I may not lose, thro' my own Fault, the Redemption he sought me by his Grace.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Seventh Prayer to our Blessed Lady.</head>
               <p n="1">1. O Glorious Blessed Virgin, how can my Prayer appear in thy sight, after having forfeited, through the vileness of my Sins, the Grace I had merited through the Passion of my Redeemer. Yet tho' I am so great a Sinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Request is just, I dare beseech thee to hear me, O my Queen and Sovereign Lady, I beseech thee to beg of thy Blessed Son, that through his infinite Goodness and Mercy, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me. And if on Account of my Sins, I deserve not this Grace, let it be granted me; to the end, that what he created to his own Image and Likeness, may not perish through my Fault. Thou art the Light of Darkness, thou the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Saints, thou the Hope of Sinners. All Generations bless thee, all the Afflicted call upon thee, all the Good meditate on thee, all Creatures rejoice in thee; the Angels in Heaven at thy Presence, the Souls in Purgatory with thy Comfort, and Men on Earth with thy Hope. All Call upon thee, thou Answerest all, and Prayest for all. What shall I, miserable Sinner, do to obtain thy Favour? For my Guilt confounds me, my Demerit afflicts me, and my Malice strikes me dumb. I beseech thee, most Precious Virgin, for the sake of that grievous Pain thou didst endure, when thou sawest thy Beloved Son carry the Cross to the place of his Death; that thou wilt Mortifie all my Passions, that what was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with his Blood, may not be Lost through my Wickedness. Bring always to my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154273:84"/> those pitiful Tears thou shedst, following him to <hi>Mount Calvary;</hi> that meditating on them, so many may flow from my Eyes, as may wash away the foulness of my Sins. For what Sinner will dare to Appear without thee, before that Eternal Judge, who tho' Patient to Endure, is Just to Punish. Who is there so Just, that will not want thy Assistance at the time of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What will become of me, Blessed Virgin, if I obtain not by thy Intercession, what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by my Sins. It is much I ask, considering my Crimes; yet it is but little, in regard of thy Virtue. All I can Ask is nothing, in regard of what you can Obtain. Reform my Life, Holy Queen of Angels, and Regulate all my Actions, in such manner, that (tho' I be a wicked Sinner) I may deserve to be mercifully heard by thee. Shew thy Mercy in my Conversion, that so the Just may praise, and the Wicked hope in thee. May the Sorrows thou endurest for the Passion of thy most Loving Son and my Redeemer Jesus Christ; be always fresh in my Memory; and may thy Grief be the Food of my Heart. May thy Protection never fail me, thy Compassion forsake me, or thy Memory cast me off. If thou, Blessed Virgin, forsak'st me, who will support me? If thou forget'st me, who will remember me? If thou (who art the North-Star, and Guide to such as are astray) dost not Light me, what will Become of me? Suffer me not to be Tempted by the Enemy of Mankind; and if he Tempt me, suffer me not to fall; and if I fall, help me to rise. Who ever called upon thee, whom thou didst not hear? Who ever asked any thing of thee, and had it not granted? Who ever serv'd thee, and was not magnificently rewarded. Most
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154273:85"/> Glorious Virgin, make my Heart throughly sensible of the Affliction thou enduredst, when after thy most Precious Son was taken down from the Cross, thou receivedst him in thy Arms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that most Precious Countenance, adored by the Angels, then spit upon by wicked Men; and considering the strange Cruelty wherewith the Innocence of the Just Man suffer'd, for the Disobedience of the Sinner. I meditate, Blessed Queen, in what a Condition you then was; your Arms open, your Eyes faded, your Head hanging down, your Countenance wan, and feeling more Torment in your Heart, than any other could possibly bear in their Body. Let these dismal Words, which you might have spoken to all that beheld thee, ever resound in my Ears: <hi>O all ye that pass by the way, behold and see, whether there be any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow.</hi> To the end, that through them I may obtain to be heard by you. Pierce my Soul with that bitter Sorrow, which overwhelm'd yours, when you laid into the Sepulcher the disjointed Body of your most Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Son; that I may remember I am but Earth, and that in the end I must restore what I had of her; that so the fading Glory of this World may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me. Make me remember how oft you turn'd back, to look on the Sepulcher where so much Goodness was enclosed; that so I may obtain so much Grace, that you may turn back to regard my Prayer. Let the Meditation of your Solitude that dismal Night, be my only Company: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering you had nothing left alive but your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, drinking the Water of your sad Tears, and feeding on your doleful Contemplations: That by lamenting the Grief you sustain'd on Earth, I may come to see the Glory you obtain'd in Heaven for all Eternity, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head type="sub">An Introduction to the following Prayers, which are proper to be said before the Holy Communion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL the Sacraments of the New Law require a fit Disposition and Preparation for the receiving of them worthily; but some more than others. For the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism requires one sort of Preparation, and that of Extream Unction another: Confession requires yet a greater; because there must be a particular Declaration and Acknowledgment of our Sins: And the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist requires yet a greater than any; because being the Noblest of the Sacraments, it ought to be receiv'd with more Veneration, and a more serious Disposition. For explaining whereof, it must be understood, that the proper Effect of this Sacrament, is the Spiritual Nourishment of the Soul, which is an inward Taste of God, and an Encouragement to Live well. Now for the Enjoying this Benefit entirely, it is necessary, that on Man's Part, when he Receives, there be Actual Devotion and Attention to God: For tho' Grace may be receiv d without this Disposition, yet this Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past requires this sort of Devotion and Attention. Now to the end our Heart may be thus dispos'd, and clear from all Worldly Thoughts and Care at that time, it is necessary to prepare it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; not only with the Sacrament of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, purposely ordain'd for this end, but also with Holy Prayers, Reading, and Meditations: That by these Means at the time of Receiving it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154273:86"/> may be the purer, and more devoutly inclin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. For if it be in this Disposition, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Fire sooner takes hold of dry Wood, so also will the Flame of that Divine Fire sooner blaze out in the Heart; so that it will be Purify'd, Inflam'd and Transform'd in God. To this end the following Prayers may somewhat help, being useful before and after Communion, if read, not Cursorily, but with such Leisure and Attention, and with such Pauses and Stops, as becomes so great a Mystery.</p>

ALmighty and Eternal God, behold I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Sacrament of thy only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, my Lord Jesus Christ, as a sick Man to the Physician of Life, as one foul to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Mercy, as a blind Man to the Light of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Brightness, as a poor Man to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and as one naked to the King of Glory. I beseech thy Infinite Goodness and Mercy, O Lord, that thou wilt be pleas'd to heal my Diseases, cleanse my Filth, enlighten my Blindness, enrich my Poverty, and cloath my Nakedness, that so I may receive the Bread of Angels, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, with such Reverence and Fear, such Sorrow and Love, such Faith and Purity, and with so Holy a Purpose, and such Humility, as may conduce to the Salvation of my Soul. Grant, O Lord,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:154273:86"/> that I may not only receive this Sacrament, but also the Virtue and Grace of the Sacrament. O most Merciful Father, grant, that I may behold for ever, and without Disguise, this thy only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son in the Life to come, whom I purpose now to receive hidden under the Species of Bread in this Life, and that I may there reign with him for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head type="sub">A Prayer to be said before and after the Holy Communion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Give thee Praise and Thanks, my Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ for all thy Benefits; and particularly for the Mystery of thy Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, for thy Holy Nativity, for thy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, for thy Presentation in the Temple, for thy Flight to <hi>Egypt,</hi> for thy Fasting, and being Tempted; for the Labour thou sustainedst in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, for thy continual Preaching, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions thou enduredst, for the Pains and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy most bitter Passion, and for all thou didst and sufferedst for me in this World; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, for the Love wherewith thou didst en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, which surpassed all the rest. And above all this, I give thee Thanks, because thou art pleased to admit so vile and miserable a Sinner to thy Table, and to make him Partaker of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the Inestimable Treasure of thy Holy Passion. O my God, and my Saviour, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn can I make for this unheard of Mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou art pleas'd to bow down the Heavenly Height of thy Greatness, and to descend to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154273:87"/> Abyss of our Vileness? Who art thou, and who are we, that thou, the King of Majesty, shouldst descend into our Mud Cottages. The Heaven is thy Seat, and the Earth thy Footstool, and all the Universe is fill'd with the Glory of thy Majesty; how then, O Lord, comes it to pass, that thou wilt take up in such vile Lodgings? <hi>Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> (says <hi>Solomon) that God should live upon Earth among Men? For if the Heaven, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this little House, which I have built?</hi> O how wonderful it is, that he who sits above the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, and from thence beholds the Abyss, should now descend to seat himself in this Abyss, and there place the Throne of his Majesty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thy Infinite Goodness thought it too little to have sent the Angels to attend on us, but even thou thy self, the Lord of the Angels, wouldst come to us, and enter into our Bodies and Souls, and there thy self manage the Affairs of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There thou visitest the Sick, strengthnest the Weak, liftest up those that are Fallen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortest the Afflicted, encouragest the Fearful, guidest those that Stray, givest Food to the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and enflamest with thy Love such as are Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm. In fine, it is thou thy self that curest all our Distempers, and that not by the Ministry of others, but with thy own Hands, nor with any other Medicine, but with thy Flesh, and thy Blood. O thou truly good Shepherd, how faithfully hast thou fulfill'd thy Promise made by the Mouth of the Prophet, saying, <hi>I will feed my Sheep, and I will make them lye down;</hi>

                  <hi>that which was lost, I will seek, and that which was cast away, I will bring again, and that which was weak, I will strengthen, and that which was fat and strong, I will keep.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:154273:87"/>3. But who can be worthy of these Graces, and this Admirable Union? There is neither in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth any Merit, that of it self can attain to it. It is therefore thy Mercy, O Lord, that makes us capable, and thy Grace renders us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so great a Good. And since without it no Man is worthy, may thy Grace assist me, my God, may it unite me with thee, may it make me Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of this Mystery, and Thankful for so Inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a Benefit. Let thy Grace make up what is defective in me, let thy Mercy forgive my Sins, let thy Spirit prepare my Soul, let thy Merits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich my Poverty, and let thy Precious Blood wash away all the Stains of my Life, that so I may worthily receive the Sacrament of thy most Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I rejoice, my God, when I remember, that great Miracle, wrought by the Body of <hi>Eliseus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was Dead, which brought to Life another dead Man, accidentally hid in his Tomb by Thieves, and laid near to him. Now if there was such Virtue in the dead Body of a Prophet, how much more must there be in the living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Lord of the Prophets? Thou art not, O Lord, less Powerful than thy Prophet, nor is my Soul less dead than that Body, nor is there less Virtue in this touch than in that. Why then shall I not hence hope the same Benefit? Why should the Body conceiv'd in Sin work greater Miracles, than the Body conceiv'd of the Holy Ghost? Why should the Body of the Servant be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd than that of the Master? Why shall not thy Holy Body bring to Life the Soul that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to thee, since that brought to Life the Body that was put to it. And since that Body without seeking for Life, receiv'd what it sought
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154273:88"/> not, thro' the Virtue of that Holy Body; may it please thy Infinite Mercy, O my Lord, that since I seek it thro' the Means of this Venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I may be by it so brought to Life, that I may no longer live to my self, but to thee. O Good Jesus, I humbly beseech thee, for the Inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Charity and Love that made thee become Man, Suffer and Die for me; that thou wilt cleanse me of all my Sins, and adorn me with thy Virtues and Merits, and give me the Grace to receive this Sacrament with such Humility and Respect, with such Fear and Trembling, with such Sorrow and Repentance for my Sins, with such a Purpose of Amendment, and with such Love and Charity, as becomes so profound a Mystery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Grant me also such Purity of Intention, that I may receive this Sacrament, to the Glory of thy Holy Name, for a Remedy against my Weakness and Frailty, for my Defence against the common Enemy, as Food to maintain my Spiritual Life, that by Means of this Sacrament of Love, I may be wholly united to thee, and that I may offer thee this Mystery for the Salvation of all the Faithful, as well Living as Dead, to the end that all may be assisted and reliev'd by the inestimable Virtue of this Sacrament, instituted for the Good of all by thee, who livest and reignest for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>1.</hi> TO proceed still on in our <hi>Memorial,</hi> since hitherto we have spoken of Vocal Prayer, which is Easier, and more Familiar to all sorts of Persons, it will now be convenient to treat of Mental Prayer, which is more Difficult, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proper to those that are farther advanc'd. For Nature takes this Course, always ascending from Easier to more Difficult Things; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Art, which imitates Nature, ought to follow the same Method, and more especially in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for as tender Plants, when first they grow, want some Support to hold up, and help them to ascend; but when they are spread and rooted in the Earth, want no such Help, being able to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154273:89"/> themselves; even so, those who are new-born to a Spiritual Life, when they would discourse with God, must make use of some Vocal Prayers to raise up their Hearts, and instruct them how to deliver themselves; but when they are well grounded and rooted in his Love, and begin to feel some Devotion, that will furnish Words, and teach them how they ought to Talk and Converse with him. Now because we have handled this sort of Prayer at large in the Book of Prayer and Meditation, at present we will only treat of the Subject of Mental Prayer, that is, on what things we may most profitably employ our Consideration. To this Purpose we here set down the Principal Mysteries of the Life of Christ, with some other things to this Purpose, which were not mention'd in that Book.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Benefit of Mental Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT has been already declar'd in another Place, that there is no Essential Difference betwixt Vocal and Mental Prayer; for the one as well as the other is an Act of that most Noble Virtue, call'd Religion, and the End of them both is the same; to wit, to beg a Spiritual Alms of our Lord, tho' the one asks it with only the Heart, and the other with the Mouth and Heart jointly. There can only be allotted an accidental Difference on Account of the Circumstances, which may attend either sort of Prayer. For whereas the Spirit and Devotion, wherewith we pray, is as it were the Life of Prayer; therefore of Consequence one sort of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154273:89"/> Prayer will be so much more excellent than the other, by how much the more it has of Spirit and Devotion. It follows, that if he who prays by his Beads, or by his Book, has a greater Share of Spirit and Devotion than the other, his Prayer will be more Efficacious and Effectual; for, to pray in this manner contributes much towards being heard, according to the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> who says,<note place="margin">Psal. 118.145.</note>
                  <hi>I have cried in my whole Heart, hear me, O Lord.</hi> And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place,<note place="margin">Psal. 9.13.</note>
                  <hi>He hath not forgotten the Cry of the Poor.</hi> That is, the Prayer that is poured forth with Spirit; for to pray with Spirit is only to beg with Hearty Desire, and Sincere Sighs, as has been said already. Such was the Prayer of <hi>Anna,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Samuel;</hi> who being upbraided by her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, pray'd to God with great Anguish of Heart; whence it came to pass, that thro' the Greatness of her Eagerness she made such outward Gestures, as perswaded the Priest <hi>Heli</hi> that she was drunk; yet it was not the Wine he imagin'd, but the Wine of Devotion that had overflowed her Soul, being plentifully let in at the Flood-gate of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, it is to be observ'd, that the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Pondering of any Divine Subject is also call'd Mental Prayer, tho' whilst we are thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, we ask nothing. And it cannot be deny'd, but that this Consideration is very Profitable and Advantagious; for as the Speculative Part and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Human Sciences is a Principal Method to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Human Learning, so the Consideration of Divine Things is a Considerable Means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Divine Wisdom, which is the greatest of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, to which all the others are subservient.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:154273:90"/>3. Besides, this Meditation is a Principal Means for obtaining of true Devotion, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Man ready and active for the Exercise of all Virtues, (as shall be declar'd hereafter) and this it is that best demonstrates to us the Excellency of this Exercise.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This sort of Prayer has also another good Effect, which is, that it digests and gives a Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Spiritual Things. For he that Prays by his Beads or Book, runs over things more lightly, till he comes to the end of his usual Prayers; but he who meditates, does not so; for he abides upon one Word of Scripture, or one Passage of the Life of our Saviour, as long as he finds any Matter of Consideration, which sometimes lasts along space, as we read of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who spent a whole Night, repeating these Words, <hi>My God, may I know thee, may I know my self.</hi> Now one My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery thus seriously consider'd, is of more Profit than many others cursorily run over. It is true, that he who Prays by his Book may do the same, if every time he touches some tender Passage, he would there make a Stand, and there leisurely Consider what the Holy Ghost puts into his Heart. Thus some People are a long time saying the <hi>Lord's-Prayer,</hi> or the <hi>Creed,</hi> spending much time in pondering the Mysteries therein contained, to their no small Profit. And this sort of Prayer (besides that it is easie for all sorts of People) is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and is the same we here teach and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; to wit, that which is joined with Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Subject of Mental Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN regard that (as was said above) by Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer, is understood the Meditation of Things Divine; it will be convenient to declare what is the Subject of this Consideration, which is the proper Argument of this Treatise. To Answer this in short, All such things as can move our Heart to love or fear God, to hate Sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Subject Matter of Meditation. So consequently is all the Holy Scripture, all the Lives and Examples of Saints, and in short, the whole Frame of the World, with all the Creatures in it: For in all these a Devout Man will find Matter to consider on. But amidst all these things, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> especially assigns Two, in his 2. 2. <hi>Q.</hi> 82. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. where he says, That true Devotion is raised in us, by the Consideration as well of the Divine Perfections, as of his Benefits bestow'd on us; and also by the Consideration of our own Imperfections and Sins; for the one advances us in Charity, the other in Humility: And so the one is like taking a strong Root below, and the other like growing up and spreading above: And both are requisite for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Spiritual Life. The better to explain this Point, I will here insert what Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Cajetan</hi> writes upon these Words of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> which is worthy to be observed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Third Article you are to observe Two Intrinsick Causes of Devotion, which the holy Doctor assigns; and are, on the one side, The Meditation of the Divine Perfections and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154273:91"/> Benefits; and on the other, The Reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own Imperfections. To the First of these belongs the Consideration of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Mercy, Justice, Charity, and Beauty, with all his other Attributes and Perfections; and above all, his Love to all Men in general, and to every one in particular. Also the Consideration of Divine Benefits, and principally our Creation, Redemption, Baptism, the Holy Sacrament, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspirations, God's often Calling upon us, either by Himself, or other Second Causes; his giving us so much Time to Repent, his delivering of us mercifully from so many Dangers of Body and Soul; and his deputing the Angels for our Guardians; with all other Benefits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the Second appertains the Reflection upon a Man's own Self; that is, on his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Miseries, with regard to his Sins past and present: The great Disposition we are always in to Sin: The Havock we have made of Stock, (that is, of the Endowments and Gifts of Nature God bestowed on us) by habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating the Faculties of our Soul to do Evil: Our Residence in this Region is so far distant and separated from the Conversation and Friendship of Almighty God: The Perversness of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which is more sensible of Temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages or Losses, than of the Spiritual: Our Want of Virtue: The Spiritual Wounds and Sores of our Soul; which are Blindness, Malice, Concupiscence, and Weakness: The Chains which bind our Hands and Feet, which are the great Obstructions to doing Well, proceeding from our Flesh: Our living in Darkness, Stench, and Bitterness, without being sensible of it: Our not hearing the Voice of the Shepherd, which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154273:91"/> Calls us inwardly: And above all, our having so often rendred God our greatest Enemy by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Mortal Sin; and consequently, our having done him so great Wrong, as if we had cast him off from being our God, and had plac'd in his stead, and made Gods of our Belly, Money, Honour, Pleasure, and such-like things, which we preferr'd before, and made more account of, than of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These Meditations, which ought to be daily us'd by Religious and Pious Persons, (laying aside Vocal Prayers, to which we are not in Duty bound) produce Devotion, and with it all other Virtues: And such as at least once a Day do not Exercise themselves in this manner, do not deserve the Name of Religious or Pious Persons. For as the Effect is not to be attain'd without the Cause, or the End without the Means, nor the Port to be reach'd without Sailing to it; so neither can True Religion be attain'd, without a Repetition and Frequenting the Causes and Means from which it proceeds. Thus far are the Words of <hi>Cajetan:</hi> By which you may perceive how highly he Extols, and how earnestly he Recommends the Use of Meditation. For he says, that the Daily Use of these Considerations does principally produce Devotion, and consequently all other Virtues, to which Devotion is the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive. Secondly, That they do not deserve the Name of Religious or Pious Persons, who do not at least once a Day employ some Time in this Exercise. Thirdly, That as the End cannot be attain'd without the Means, or the Port be reach'd without Sailing to it; so neither can we attain to the Purity and Perfection of Religion, without the Use of Prayer and Meditation, which are the Causes that produce it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:154273:92"/>5. Now as to what he says, that to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose must be laid aside the much Talk us'd in Vocal Prayer; he says it not to condemn the Use of Vocal Prayer: For it is not agreeable with Reason, to commend Mental Prayer, and condemn the Vocal. For if it be a Holy Thing to Call upon God with our Heart, how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than Holy, to add to the Voice of the Heart that also of the Mouth and Tongue, which he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to praise him? But this he says, to condemn not the Use, but the Abuse of Vocal Prayer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some Persons are guilty, who Pray so fast, so cursorily, and so destitute of Devotion or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that they reap little or no Benefit by this sort of Prayer. Nay, sometimes instead of reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefit, they will suffer Loss; when they go about to Pray and Converse with God, without that Reverence, Attention, and Circumspection they ought to use; as the same Doctor declares in his Treatise of Sins. And would to God there were not too many guilty of this Fault. But whosoever observes, after what manner many Priests and Clergy-Men in this Age Repeat or Sing the Divine Office, as well in publick, as in private; and how little Profit and Devotion they reap by it; may easily perceive how justly this Doctor blames not the Use, but the Abuse of this sort of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As often as I read this Doctrine, I confess, Christian Reader, I much admire to see in how few Words this Doctor compriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d all Christian Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and almost all the Spiritual Instruction that is diffus'd in all the Pious Books in the World: For whoever shall read them with Attention, will find, that tho' they seem to differ in Expression▪ yet in reality they aim at no more than what this Doctor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154273:92"/> taught, neither do they extol or commend their Exercises more than he does. By which it plainly appears, that the Church is guided by the same Spirit; and that all God's Servants have the same Master, since they all tend to the same End, and travel the same Road. Do thou as this Doctor teaches; that is, set apart a Time every Day to think on thy Sins and God's Benefits, among which, the chiefest is that of our Redemption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the principal Mysteries of the Life of Christ: And as a clean Creature, endeavour to ruminate on the Words and Actions of our Lord; for it is nothing else that the Devotion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> and all Books of Devotion teach. The Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the same; but that as Palates differ, some dress it one way, and some another. Let him that can read the <hi>Opuscula</hi> of S. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who was a Doctor so noted for Learning, Devotion, Piety, and Prudence to Govern, that in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year after his Profession he was chosen General of his Order, and after that, Cardinal: There he may see into how many several sorts of Dresses this Saint puts the Life and Passion of our Saviour; teaching how to Meditate upon it in one place by the Hours of the Day, in another by the Days of the Week, in another reducing it to Hymns and Vocal Prayers, and in another redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it into a Tree of the Life of Christ Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd. This the holy Man did; because on the one hand he was sensible of how great Importance this Holy Exercise is to us; and on the other, how Various Mens Inclinations are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made so many several Dishes of the same Spiritual Food.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I shall bring no farther Testimonies of the great Benefit reap'd by this Exercise, than what
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154273:93"/> the same holy Doctor produces, that is, the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of several Persons, who he writes in his Time found great Advantage by this Exercise: And the same we may alledge at this Time; for whoever shall look into this Affair, will certainly find, that all Persons who have set Times assign'd to employ themselves in these Holy Meditations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, generally-speaking, are better advanc'd in God's Service, and in the Way of Virtue; and are readier to Practice all Works of Piety and Mercy, and to endure the Hardships and Crosses of Penance, and more careful to avoid all Sin.</p>

            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Conclusion of all that has been said.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOW according to this Doctrine, we have here three Sorts of Things, which we may call the Subject Matter of Meditation. The First is, The Divine Perfections; such as, God's Goodness, his Charity, Beauty, Justice, Mercy, and Providence, with the like. The Second is, The Divine Benefits; and particularly the Benefit of Redemption, which includes the Mysteries of the Life of our Saviour; because all of them are part of this Benefit. The Third is, The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one's Self; that is, of our Failings and Miseries: Whence proceeds Self-contempt, and the Virtue of Humility, which is the Foundation of all Virtue. Among which Considerations, the First, which is of the Divine Perfections, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it particularly serves to excite the Love of God) shall be left for the following Treatise, which is appropriated for this Matter; but of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154273:93"/> the other two we shall speak in this Place. From these as out of a Publick Stock, a Man may gather Matter of Consideration as often as he would employ himself in the Study of this Divine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are some Persons so full of Business, that they can retire but once a Day; these may every time chuse One or Two Passages of the Life of our Saviour, or of Divine Benefits; and thus may they proceed from Day to Day, till they have run thro' all the Mysteries or Benefits here mention'd; and being come to the end, they may begin again, and proceed in the same manner as long as they live. This may be look'd upon as a Spiritual <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which must in this manner be gone over gradually; and when ended, be began again; for upon this Spiritual Motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our Happiness, as the Government of this Inferior World depends on the Sun's proceeding thro' the <hi>Zodiack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But others, who have less Business (such as are the Clergy and Religious Persons, whose Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is to be employ'd in the Service of God, and to pray for the Sins of the World; as also others, who have little Employment) may well retire Twice or Thrice a Day, and may according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divide these Mysteries in such manner, that some particular Passages may be assign'd for every time; and when they have run thro' them all, they may, as was said before, begin again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So much Variety of Matter is assign'd for this Purpose, to the end a Man may not be oblig'd every Day to meditate upon the same thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it might become nauseous to those that are not arriv'd to Perfection. On the contrary, the Variety of Mysteries contributes much to the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:154273:94"/> up of Devotion, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his <hi>Opuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> testifies. Hence it is, that very often Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, just after their Conversion, feel more Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and have a greater Gust of Spiritual Affairs, than they do when they are farther advanc'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Novelty and Greatness of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Things, whereof before they had no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, raises in them greater Admiration, and causes a more sensible Feeling.</p>
            </div>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Five Parts that may intervene in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exercise.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THo' the Consideration of those things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-recited, be the Principal Subject of this sort of Prayer whereof we now treat, yet there are other things that must attend, precede, and follow it. Before the Meditation must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede a Devout Preparation, by which a Man fits himself for to enter upon this Exercise; and three things may follow after it, which are, A Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, an Offering, and a Petition, whereof we shall speak briefly in this Place, because they have already been handled more at large in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>§ <hi>I.</hi> Of the Preparation.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. AS to the First Part, which is <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a Man must seek a convenient Time and Place for this Purpose, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:154273:94"/> of his Life. As to Time, Midnight, or the Morning early, is very proper; and the Place is so much the better, by how much it is more Dark and Solitary, that so the Heart may be the more recollected, the Sight having nothing to distract it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When a Man is thus placed, and his Heart and Forehead arm'd with the Sign of the Cross, let him lift up the Eyes of his Soul, to consider these Three Things, <hi>viz.</hi> What he is about to ask, what he is to do, and with whom he is to discourse.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to the first Point, if he considers what he is about to ask, he will find he is going to beg Grace and Glory, with all other things that may conduce to these Ends, which are the greatest things that can be ask'd, and therefore this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be attended with all those Conditions we spoke of before, and particularly with great Attention and Humility of Heart, as was said in that place; for these things cause such Petitions not to return empty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now if you proceed further, and consider what you are going to do, you will find you are there going to seek after the Spirit of Devotion, thro' the Consideration of Divine Things, whence it proceeds, and thus you will perceive that more is requir'd here than in other Cases; for (as has been said) in other Cases it is enough to obtain a Virtual, tho' not an Actual Attention, but this is not enough for the obtaining of Devotion (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) because this Pious Affection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an Actual Attention and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Things. Hence you may gather, how intent you ought to be in this Affair, that your Heart may not be distracted, for otherwise you will not obtain that which you aim at.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:154273:95"/>6. But if you consider the Third Point, which is, whom you are to discourse with, you will find you are going to confer with that Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, which fills the Heavens and the Earth; whence you may gather, not only with how great Attention, but also with how profound Humility and Reverence you are to speak to so great a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign about such Important Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now that we may be the more sensible, and the better understand, that when we pray, our Words are not carry'd away by the Air, nor is he who is to hear us far off, let us place before our Eyes the Presence of this Lord, who is in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not only by his Omnipotency, an Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but also in his true and real Essence. For wheresoever there is any thing that has a Being, there is he as the Cause and Original of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he gives to all Creatures; for the Cause and the Effect must of Necessity be together, and inseparable. Therefore it is necessary, that God be present in every Place; and so the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> imagin'd,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 17.</note> when he said, <hi>Our Lord liveth, the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>in whose Sight I stand.</hi> So must thou believe he is present at thy Prayer, hearing thy Words, beholding thy Devotion, and taking Delight in it; for tho he universally be present at all things, yet he more particularly attends those that Pray, as the Holy Scripture tells us, saying, <hi>Neither is there other Nation so great, that hath God's approaching into them, as our God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at all our Petitions.</hi> Now what more can you desire than to be thus assured (tho' you see it not with the Eyes of the Flesh) that he sees and hears you, who is so ready, and so able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you?</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:154273:95"/>8. When therefore you are plac'd in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, you must make him most profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; that is, to acknowledge the Majesty of him you are about to speak to. To this purpose you must lift up your Thoughts, to consider the Greatness, Majesty, Immensity, Omnipotence, Wisdom, Goodness, Beauty, and other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Supream Lord, which exceed all Human Understanding; and this Consideration is enough to make you humble your self, even to the Dust of the Earth, and to sink you to the deepest Abyss of Self-Contempt in the Presence of so much Majesty. This also will cause you to appear before this Lord with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and the more your Heart is seized with this Fear, the less it will stray or wander to other Foreign Thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Having made this Submission, (for the Just Man at first is his own Accuser) let him begin presently to accuse himself of his Sins, briefly calling to mind his past ill Life, and begging Pardon for it, that so he may gain the Favour of the Judge, before whom he is to plead his Cause. To this effect he may devoutly repeat the <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor,</hi> or the <hi>Miserere,</hi> or some such like Piece of Devotion, thus to remove that Coldness, which commonly possesses the Heart at the beginning of Prayer. And let him not only beg of our Lord Forgiveness of his Sins, but also his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that during that short time he is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him, he may be possess'd with such Fear and Reverence, as is due to so much Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and with such Attention and Humility, as is requisite for receiving of the Holy Ghost, and the Grace of Devotion, which is bestow'd upon all those who strictly persevere in this Exercise.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:154273:96"/> This may suffice as to the Preparation, wherein a Man may dilate himself as much as he pleases, reflecting upon his own Imperfections and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as shall be said hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 It will also conduce much to this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Thoughts are much distracted, to settle them, by reading some Godly Book, or by repeating some Vocal Prayer, (as was said above) for these, when devoutly said, help to settle our Thoughts.</p>

                  <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of Meditation.</head>
                  <p n="11">11. AFter this Preparation, follows the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Consideration of some of the Points mentioned it the foregoing Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> Of some Passage of the Life of our Saviour, or of some one of his Benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is as it were the Foundation and Groundwork of this Exercise. And because the Life of our Saviour is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subject of this Consideration, it will not be amiss in this Place, to show how we are to behave our selves therein.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now to this Purpose, it will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that a Man read in this, or some like Book, that Passage or Passages of the Life of Christ he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to meditate upon, unless he have the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them already in his Mind, having read them over other times; and then when he would ruminate and digest it, he must make Account, as if that Mystery were actually transacted before him, representing it so in his Imagination, since that Faculty was given us for the like Uses. Let him endeavour to do this with an Humble, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate, Loving, and Devout Heart, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:154273:96"/> himself with beholding that Mystery in an easie manner, without diving into profound Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, only reflecting on the Principal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that attend it. These (if we go upon the Life and Passion of our Saviour) are Four, <hi>viz.</hi> Who suffers; For whom he suffers; For what Cause; and In what manner. Who? The God of Infinite Majesty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whom? For Man, a Creature so ungrateful and unworthy. For what Cause? Only for his own Goodness and Mercy. In what manner? With wonderful Humility, Charity, Meekness, Patience, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are the Principal Circumstances to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in these Mysteries.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is to be observ'd, that tho' this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise be an Act of the Will and the Understanding, because the Understanding considers things, whilst the Will feels a Compassion, and encreases in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards them, yet more Regard is to be had to that Part which regards the Will, than to that of the Understanding, because it is the most advantagious. For there are many Learned Men, who have lofty Notions of God, and yet love him but little: And the Apostle says, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Philosophers in the World, who knew God, and yet did not serve or glorifie him.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For this Reason we do not here so much endeavour to obtain a Speculative Knowledge of God (tho' it be Good in it self) as his Fear and Love, a Hatred to Sin, Contempt of the World, and one's self, the Joy of the Holy Ghost, and Fervent Devotion, with other the like Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are Motions and Acts of the Will, wherein consists our Happiness. But because the Will (as was said above) is a blind Faculty, which cannot act, unless some Light or Direction of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154273:97"/> Understanding precede, therefore we here make use of the Understanding, that it may Enlighten, Guide, and Stir up the Will to these Affections. So that as the Needle is necessary for sewing, not because it sews it self but the Thread, yet the Thread cannot pass without it; so also the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Understanding is necessary for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Acts of the Will; tho' the Principal Work be that of the Will, yet I grant the Comparison does not hold in all Respects, but only so far as the one is the Means of performing the other. Therefore, as it would be a great Oversight for a Man to spend all his Time and Industry upon the Means, without regarding the End; so also are they overseen, who when they consider on these Sacred Mysteries, make more use of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, than of the Will, and seem rather to be studying to make a Sermon, than meditating by way of Prayer, and to improve their Taste of Divine Things.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For the avoiding of this Inconveniency, a Man must endeavour as much as in him is, to apply the Sensitive Part of his Will to these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, thinking on them with an Humble, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Fearful Heart, altogether abash'd in the Presence of God, with whom he confers, for that is the End and Principal Fruit of this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. For when our Saviour was born, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did not bring Peace to Men of good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but to those of Good Will, in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof consists our Sanctification; for we often see a good Understanding without a Good-Will, but never is Good-Will found without sound Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. This Rule is to be observ'd not only every time a Man retires to Meditate, but also as often
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:154273:97"/> as at other times, either by Day or Night he lifts up his Heart to God, applying his Will with as much Humility and Reverence, and with as much Love and Devotion as possibly he can. And let him assure himself, (if he makes this Habitual to him) that in a very short time he will reap inestimable Benefit. For when once his Heart is thus Habituated, he will find in it so Sweet a Receptacle and Dwelling-place for God, that he will not know how to Live without the Peace, Comfort, and Spiritual Refection this brings with it.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Now when he has in this Manner, and with this Sort of Affection, consider'd any of these Mysteries, if still he find his Heart cold and dry, let him not dismay; for our Lord is wont bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to reward those, who faithfully and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expect his Coming to Visit them; and who do what in them lies, making Amends for his Delay with some particular Grace.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Neither let him tire himself, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring as it were forcibly to express Devotion; but let him rest satisfi'd with an humble and plain View of these Mysteries, and with accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying our Saviour in these his Acts of Mercy undertaken for our sake. Nor ought he to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd, tho' he be molested with distracted Thoughts; for it is not always in the power of Man to avoid them; nor is it often the Fault of the Person, but rather of our corrupt Nature; provided that he do what in him is, to dispel such Thoughts, and manfully struggle against them. Neither must he desist, because at the first breaking Ground he finds not Water; for very often that is granted in the End to him that faithfully perseveres, which at the first was deny'd; and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154273:98"/> Perseverance is the Key which open the Door to Devotion. Labour therefore, dear Brother, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe, and be importunate; calling to Mind, That the Favours God sometimes bestows on this Account are so great, that many Years Sufferings would be well bestow'd to purchase them.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. It is true, that one of the principal Causes of this Tepidity is, that Man's Heart is often employ'd upon a multitude of Worldly Business, which occasion it to meet much Difficulty, and spend much Time before it can fix upon the Spiritual. For this Reason it is convenient to settle it, as much as possible, upon the Study of Divine Affairs; for being so kept Warm and Devout, we shall easily lift it up to God when we please. Two Things principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to this End. The First is, The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reading of Spiritual and Devout Books, which keeps the Heart still employ'd on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is so familiar to it. The Second and Chiefest is, To endeavour as much as possible to keep always in the Presence of God, and never to lose Sight of him: Or at least, to lift up the Heart to him many times in the Day and Night by some short Prayers, making those very Things we see or handle, the Motive. To this purpose, a Man must have certain sort of Prayers and Meditations appropriated for his Going to Bed, his Rising, for the Time of Eating, Discoursing, or Doing Business, for such Times as he is under Temptation, when he hears the Clock Strike, when he sees the Green Fields Adorn'd with Flowers, or the Heaven Distinguish'd with Stars, or when he sees in his Neighbour any Corporal or Spiritual Infirmities; that all these Things may be to him Motives of Lifting up his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154273:98"/> Heart to God; and that by the help of this Fuel, <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e may always keep the Fire of Divine Love kindled in his Breast. For as dry Wood soon flames, so Devotion soon takes fire in a Heart that is always kept warm by the continual Use of Prayer, Reading, and Meditation.</p>

                  <p n="20">20. AFter the Meditation, may ensue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Thanksgiving, as well for that particular Mystery and Benefit, which has been the Subject of our Consideration, as for all other Divine Benefits, either General or Special, Visible or Occult, whereof we shall treat hereafter. And here we may call upon all Creatures in Heaven and Earth, to the end they may all Assist us, in Blessing and Giving Thanks to our Lord for all these Benefits; as was shown in the former Book, and in the Prayer that is there appointed to be said immediately after our Rising in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p n="21">21. AFter this Thanksgiving, may follow a devout Offering up of our Selves, of All we Do in this World, and of all our Sufferings; that it may all tend and be directed to the Glory and Honour of our Lord: For having consider'd and acknowledg'd the Benefits receiv'd, it follows of course, that the Heart with the Prophet ask, <hi>What shall I give to the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 12▪</note>

                  <p n="22">22. But besides all this, he may and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Offer all the Sufferings and Merits of Christ our Saviour, which is the most Precious, most Efficacious, and most Meritorious Offering that can be presented, and which is wholly ours; since the Lord thereof is ours, our Flesh, and our Blood, our Preserver and Redeemer, who in his Last Will left us Heirs of all his Merits and Sufferings. Therefore we may Enumerate and Offer them up to the Eternal Father on our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, for Remission of our Sins, Redress of our Miseries, and to the Glory of his Holy Name.</p>

                  <head>§. <hi>V.</hi> The Petition.</head>
                  <p n="23">23. THen may follow the <hi>Petition,</hi> containing all that is requisite for our Salvation, as has been declar'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> II. of the foregoing Treatise, in the fifth Condition, where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Prayer</hi> is handled. But here it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, That in going through those Five Parts, he that Prays ought to labour as much as in him is, to Confer with Almighty God, in whose Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence he is, with all Humility. For the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with the Lord of so much Majesty, does more elevate the Spirit, and requires more Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reverence, and Devotion, in respect to the Person discours'd with, than when a Man speaks to his own Soul, or when he considers some Holy
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154273:99"/> Thing, pondering upon it within himself; as when a Man thinks of Death, or the Last Judgment, or on the Pains of Hell, or the like. For which Reason, among these Five Parts spoken of, the Chiefest are the Three last, <hi>viz.</hi> the Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the Offertory, and the Petition, because they cannot be put in Practice without actually speaking with God; either giving him Thanks, or asking some Benefit, or offering up one self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which, as has been said, does more lift up the Spirit, and seems to draw it up to that Lord who is above. Therefore a Man must endeavour, where it may be in the Preparation and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to discourse with God in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. These (Christian Reader), are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Parts of Prayer, which are often recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in several Places of Holy Writ, and in the Doctrin of Holy Men, which I omit to avoid Tediousness; and these are to be practis'd and us'd at the same time when a Man is retir'd, as has been here express'd, tho' briefly, because this Subject has been handled more at large in the Book of Prayer and Meditation.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Yet here I must declare, that this Order is set down here not as a Law or Prescript, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be observ'd, but only as an Instruction to those that are ignorant in this Course; for when they are once advanc'd, and have been admitted to the Bridegroom's Chamber, and to the Seller of Precious Wines, then Experience and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will better teach them what they are to do. For Experience teaches, that if you only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms commend Prayer and Meditation to a young Beginner, without putting him in the Way, and shewing him the Manner and Subject of this Exercise, then all that your Exhortation will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154273:100"/> will be, that he will meditate sometimes one thing, and sometimes another, with a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Heart, and without settling upon any Pious Matter. Which tho' it be a sort of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is not of that Advantagious Sort, which we here design to speak of. To this purpose it is to be understood, that under this Name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration Three Things are comprehended, <hi>viz.</hi> Cogitation, Meditation, and Contemplation, which differ from one another after this manner; Cogitation reflects without Trouble or Profit, or at least with little Trouble, and small Profit. Meditation insists upon a thing with Labour and Profit, but Contemplation remains fix'd upon one thing, without any Labour, but with Profit. By this Distinction may be understood how little this sort of Cogitation avails; because having no fixt Subject, or Intention, it runs thro' many Thoughts, suffering it self to be led away sometimes by one, and sometimes by another, without any Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a Careful and Diligent Attention, being sometimes here, and sometimes there, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self so coldly to this Affair, that it is easily drawn away by any Foreign Thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. For these Reasons it is convenient, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners have certain Matter prescrib'd, and also set Times for this Affair; which Times must be free from all Business of the Day, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Service of God, as the Church has them for Publick Prayers, and Celebrating the Divine Office. Neither is this so strictly requir'd, that the omitting of it should be any Sin; for at other Times, and in other Places, besides those as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, a Man may lift up his Heart to God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Means of those Meditations, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can move him to Devotion; for this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154273:100"/> being the End that is aim'd at, nothing that tends to it must be look'd upon as Foreign to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most usual Advice that is given in this Case is, That when a Man being upon one Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, another occurs, which is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and taking, he always prefer this before the other, since through it he can better attain the End sought after, which is Devotion.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Now according to this Doctrine, those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Directors, who would guide those that desire to improve in this Exercise, may use this Method. First, They must by degrees read to them, and discourse upon the Principal Passages of the Life of our Saviour, and then note those particular Points, on which they may make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, as is done hereafter. And that they may the better retain it in their Memory, it is a good Method, where it can conveniently be done, to require every Day an Account of what they read before, ordering them first to repeat the History of the Mystery, and then the Points that occurr in it for Consideration; for by this Means we find, in a few Days, Men are well Instructed, and make a good Progress. Being once put into the Way, after this manner, they may easily, of themselves, note down some Points of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the said Passages; which sometimes may serve to move them to imitate the Example of Jesus Christ, other times to give him Thanks for his Benefits; one while to Compassionate his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, another to Love and Respect a Lord, who so entirely lov'd them; and other times will produce other the like Affections and Advantages.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Having premis'd this small Introduction, we will now begin to speak of the Subject of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, or Mental Prayer, whereof this Treatise
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154273:101"/> principally consists. Now whereas among al<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Subjects, that serve for this Purpose, the Life of our Saviour is the chiefest, because it gives us the greatest Knowledge of the Divine Goodness▪ Justice, Mercy, Providence, and Love towards Men, therefore we will first treat of it, tho' with such Brevity as belongs to this Memorial, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the Subject is the most Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, most Large, and most Divine, that can be handled.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the great Benefit reap'd by a Devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Sacred Mysteries of the Life of Christ our Lord.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT were proper that before we discourse of the Consideration of the Life of our Lord, we should declare the great Benefit that is reap'd by this Exercise. But because much may be said upon this Subject, and the Brevity here propos'd does not allow of it, I shall only say in this Place, that it is this Consideration, which above all things enlightens and clears our Understanding, and gives us the greatest Knowledge of God, which is the Beginning of our Happiness. The reason is, because in this Mortal Life we do not know God in himself, but through his Works; and the more Knowledge we have of him by them, by how much they are the Greater, and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Now it being certain, that amongst all the Works of God, the Greatest, without Comparison, is the Humility of Christ our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154273:101"/> (that is, God's becoming Man for the sake of Man) so that it is which most plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates to us the Greatness of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; <hi>viz.</hi> his Wisdom, Goodness, Charity, Mercy, Justice, Providence, Meekness, and his other Attributes. This therefore is the Mystical Ladder which the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> saw, by which the Angels ascended and descended: For this is the Way that Spiritual Men rise to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and this same Way they also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to know Themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Consideration has also another Quality, that it is Universally Beneficial to all sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as well to Beginners, as to those who are arriv'd to some Perfection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For this is the Tree of Life, which stands in the midst of the Paradise of the Church, and has higher and lower Boughs; the higher for those greater Persons, who by this may ascend to the Contemplation of Divine Things, whereof we have already spoken; and the Lower are forthe Lesser, who by this Means contemplate the Greatness of Christ his Sufferings, and the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their own Sins; to excite true Sorrow for, and hatred to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is one of the Exercises most proper for a true Christian, which is always to go after Christ, and to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes. And this is that the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> teaches us, where (according to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Translation) he says, <hi>That the Just and the Faithful would be the Girdle of the Reins of Christ, and that they would always walk about him.</hi> This is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually done, when the true Servant of Christ never departs from him, nor leaves him out of sight; but keeps him company in all places, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154273:102"/> on all the Passages of his most Holy Life. For in reality Christ is nothing else (to those that have a Spiritual Sense) but a most Sweet Balsam shed abroad (as the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> terms him) who, in whatsoever Passage of his Life you behold him, always casts from him an Odour of Sanctity, Humility, Charity, Devotion, Compassion, Meekness, and of all Virtues. Hence it is, as that he whose Trade it is always to to handle and carry about him Perfumes, always smells of that he deals in; so the Christian who after this manner deals with Christ, comes in time to smell of Christ, that is, to resemble Christ in Humility, Charity, Patience, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and all other Virtues.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To this Effect was this Treatise compos'd, which consists of the principal Passages and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Life of Christ; wherein this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is observ'd, That first the History of every Passage is related, and then with the same brevity, some Pious Considerations upon it are pointed out, to lead the devout Soul into the way of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Some of these Considerations are of use to stir up Devotion, others to move Compassion, others to cause us to Imitate Christ, others to excite us to Love and Gratitude for his Benefits, and others for other the like Purposes. In this Treatise I have imitated one, among others, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO begin with the Particular Passages and Mysteries of the Life of our Saviour, the First Thing that occurrs, is the Message deliver'd by the Angel to the most Blessed Virgin. Here in the First place we ought to consider the Purity and Sanctity of this Lady, Chosen from all Eternity by God to take upon him Human Flesh from her. For as when he resolv'd to Create the First Man, he before hand provided a Place for him to dwell in, (which was the Terrestrial Paradise) so when he design d to send into the World the Second, (which was Christ) he first provided a Place to lodge him; and this was the Body and Soul of the most Holy Virgin. And as for the Earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> it was requisite to have an Earthly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so for him that came from Heaven, a Heavenly one was required; that is, one adorn'd with Heavenly Virtues and Gifts. And because it is proper to God to dispose Things suitable to the End they are made for;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:154273:103"/> Therefore as this was chosen for the Supreme Dignity, next to the Humanity of the Son of God, that is, to be his Mother; so the greatest Sanctity and Perfection next to him, was granted to her: Because she was Mother of the Holy of Holies, to her in a special manner were granted all the Graces and Priviledges granted to All Saints; and over and above she had Seven other Super-eminent and Wonderful Priviledges. The First and Greatest was, her being Mother of God; the Second, not to be subject to any Evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or Inordinate Passion; the Third, that in upwards of Sixty Years that she liv'd, she never committed Sin either Mortal or Venial, which is the greatest of Wonders; the Fourth, that she Conceiv'd by Virtue of the Holy Ghost; the Fifth, that she was Deliver'd without Pain, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Imparing her Virginity; the Sixth, that she was carry'd to Heaven in Body and Soul, so that her Body never was sensible of Corruption; the Seventh, that she is Seated next her Son, in the highest Place of Bliss, above all other Creatures. Now considering this Holy Virgin, so far exalted above all other Saints, and so full of Grace, how wonderful had it been to have seen the Life she led in this World? How wonderful to see her Purity, her Humility, her Charity, her Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, her Modesty, her Gravity, her Mercy, and all her other Virtues, which were more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than Diamonds or Rubies? How wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to see her in this World converse among Men, and live among them, who on the other hand convers'd and liv'd among Angels? How wonderful to see her Employment, her Tears, her Watching, her Abstinence, and her Prayers, wherein she spent Days and Nights with God? What can be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:154273:103"/> more wonderful, than that in above Sixty Years, that she liv'd and convers'd among Men, in a Body subject to Hunger, and other Human Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, she should never exceed one jot in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drinking, Sleeping, Talking, or any other Particular; but always keep the Faculties of her Soul, her Will, Memory, and Understanding, and Intention fix'd upon God? How full of Grace, Charity, and Heavenly Delights, must she be, who thus continu'd united to God by an Eternal Band of Love and Delight? To conclude, such was her Life, such her Purity and the Beauty of her Soul, that whoever beheld her, might through her much better discover the Wisdom, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and Goodness of God, than by the Fabrick and Beauty of the whole World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Mansion, that is, this Paradise of Pleasure, being prepar'd for this Second <hi>Adam,</hi> when the Time appointed by the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the Redeeming of the World was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was sent to this Virgin full of Grace, the Beautifulest, the Purest, and Chiefest of Creatures; for such ought to be the Mother of the World's Redeemer. When this Heavenly Ambassador had Saluted her with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Respect, had Deliver'd the Message he had to her from God, and had declar'd the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that Wonderful Mystery, which was not to be the Work of Man, but of the Holy Ghost; then the Blessed Virgin, with Submissive Words and Devout Obedience, consented to the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proposition; and that very Moment the True Omnipotent God descended into her Virgin-Womb, and was made Man; that thus God becoming Man, Man might become God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here you may first consider the Fitness of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154273:104"/> this Method made use of by Divine Wisdom for our Salvation: For this is one of the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which most powerfully do lift up the Heart of Man to admire the unspeakable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which made use of so fit Means for our Salvation; and at the same time to give him Thanks, as well for the Benefit bestow'd on us, as for the Method of it; and much more for the Love wherewith he did it, which far exceeded the rest.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here also consider the unspeakable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, who at a time when we slept, and least thought of our Salvation, and neither Offer'd up Prayers nor Sacrifices for our Relief, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self remembred to Redeem us: And whereas he could have done this many other Ways, yet he chose this, which cost him so dear, because it was most convenient for our Salvation. Of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity our Lord himself said in the Gospel; <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave it his only Son, to the end, that through the Faith and Love we bare him, we might obtain Life everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider also the wonderful Bashfulness and Silence of the Blessed Virgin, who scarce spoke a Word after the Angel had spoken many to her. Consider likewise her great Humility: For whereas she had reason to fear, beholding so bright an Angel; yet no mention is made of any such Fear, but of that she Conceiv'd at hearing her self Prais'd, and call'd Full of Grace, and Blessed amongst Women. For to those who are truly humble, there is nothing so Surprizing or Frightful, as to hear their own Praises, because these are the Thieves that steal away the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Humility.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider also the Inestimable Love the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154273:104"/> Blessed Virgin bore to Chastity, for she was the first in the World that made this Vow, having no Example to imitate. And it plainly appears how entirely she lov'd this Virtue; for that having so great an Offer made her, as to be the Mother of God, yet stood she up for the Honour of this Virtue; and, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> says, was troubled to think, Whether to this Effect, her Vow of Virginity must be dispens'd withal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Think also on her Faith, for which she was worthily commended by S. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> since she at once believ'd so many Wonders, and those so Incredible to Human Understanding. For if the Apostle so highly commends the Faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> because he believ'd that a Barren Woman would Conceive; how much greater was this Virgins Faith, who believ'd that a Virgin would bring forth, that God would become Man; and that all this would be done by the Holy Ghost, without the help of Man? Whence frail Man may learn to believe, and rely upon all the Words and Promises of God, tho' to Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they seem incredible.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Consider after this sweet Dialogue, with how much Humility and Obedience this Blessed Virgin resign'd her self up to God, saying, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. But above all, it is worth considering, what Ravishment, what Joy, and what Delight possest that most pure Heart at the coming of the Holy Ghost, at the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Word, for the Redemption of the World, for the Supreme Honour and Dignity conferred on her, and for such great Works and Wonders as were there reveal'd to, and wrought upon her. But what Understanding can attain to comprehend this Passage?</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Visitation of S. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Second Joyful Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. WHen the Angel had declar'd to the Holy Virgin, that her Kinswoman <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> in her Old Age had conceiv'd a Son, the Evangelist says, she set our with speed to Visit her; and entring into her House, and humbly Saluting her, when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> heard the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Child leap'd for Joy in her Womb; and that very Moment his Mother, S. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was replenish'd with the Holy Ghost, and cry'd out aloud, saying, <hi>Blessed art thou amongst Women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy Womb. And whence so great happiness to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here you have Three Persons to reflect upon, besides the Son of God, who wrought these Wonders; to wit, the Infant S. <hi>John,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Blessed Virgin. Observe in the Child so strange a manner of Sense and Joy, as this Evangelist mentions. For at that Moment the use of Reason was anticipated in him, and he was given to understand who that Lord was that came to him, and was inspir'd with the Sacred Mystery of the Incarnation. Thus his Soul was so overwhelm'd with Joy, that his Body was mov'd to that extraordinary Leap, by the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Spiritual Extasie. Hence you may gather, how great this Divine Illumination and Joy must be, since it could not contain it self, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the Body, and express'd it self by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154273:105"/> that unusual Motion and Leap. Hence also you may gather the greatness of the Mystery, and benefit of the Incarnation of the Son of God, since the Holy Ghost would have it Celebrated so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, and with so much Reverence by this Child; and consequently what he ought to do who is a compleat Man, since this Child being yet in his Mother's Womb express'd so great a Sense of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But in the Mother you may observe, how great Joy and Admiration possest that holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, at the sudden brightness of so great a Light; that is, at the understanding of such Wonders as were there reveal'd; for at that Moment, after a Supernatural manner, almost all the Mystery of the Gospel, and of the Redemption of Mankind, was revealed to her: For there she understood that the Virgin she beheld was Mother of God, that she had conceiv'd of the Holy Ghost, that the Son of God was contain'd in her Womb, that the Messias was come into the World, and that Mankind should be redeem'd by his coming. There she understood that the Wishes of all the Patriarchs, the Preaching of the Prophets, and the Hopes of all Ages, past, present, and to come, were fulfill'd. There she discover'd the Ineffable Mystery of the most Holy Trinity; for she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the Son of God was Conceiv'd, and Conceiv'd by Virtue of the Holy Ghost, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must also understand the distinction of the Divine Persons; to wit, the Father, whose Son was Incarnated, the Son who was Incarnate, and the Holy Ghost by whose Virtue this great Mystery was wrought. Now then consider what sweet Effects must that Pious Heart be sensible of, being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the brightness of such High and Incomprehensible Mysteries. But more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154273:106"/> if you regard the difference there is betwixt being taught by God, or by Man; for the latter only Enlightens the Understanding, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Will, but God's teaching has such Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Efficacy, that as much as it Enlightens▪ the Understanding, so much it Moves the Will, to affect the greatness of those things the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Conceives. Now if the Light of her Understanding were so great, how extraordinary must be the Affections and Motions of her Will? That is, how great the Joy, Delight, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of such Secrets. No words can sufficiently express it, as it is in it self; and by this you may see, how great the Mercies of God, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations which he bestows on his Elect, are, even in this Life, since he thus Visits and Recreats them with the Gust of such wonderful things. This the Evangelist, in one word, discovers to us, when he says, <hi>The Holy Woman cry'd out with a loud Voice;</hi> for the loudness of the Voice plainly expresses the greatness of the Passion, and Sence it proceeded from.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Having thus div'd into the Heart of this Holy Woman, next endeavour to look into the Heart of the Blessed Virgin, and to understand the Words of that wonderful Song she then sung, upon occasion of this Mystery. Consider then what Sence the Blessed Virgin must have of this Second Confirmation, and Testimony of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God had wrought in her, how her Soul must be here wrapt in Heavenly Joys, how her Eyes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd Tears of Gladness, how her Heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd with Delight, and how she acknowledg'd these extraordinary Benefits, when she began to Sing those Divine Verses of the <hi>Magnificat.</hi> How did her Soul Praise and Magnifie God, and what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:154273:106"/> Heavenly Sweetness fill'd her Spirit, seeing her <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>he Just, who are so greatly Visited and Comforted by God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider also, that as this Holy Virgin knew so much of the Mercy and Goodness of God, and of the Means of obtaining it (which is Humility) so she employ'd all that Hymn in declaring those Two Things, because she who had been so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by means of this Virtue, could not more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily spend her Praises on any other Subject, that thus he who desires to obtain Divine Grace, may understand he is to take this same way to look for it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor ought we here less to make reflection upon the Dignity and Excellency of this Blessed Virgin, for no sooner had the Voice of her Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sounded in the Ears of St. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than God in a most special manner was with her, for immediately she was fill'd with the Holy Ghost, by whom she was given to understand so many and so great Mysteries. So that, even as when at the beginning of the World God said, <hi>Be Light made,</hi> and immediately Light was made; so when the Blessed Virgin said, <hi>God be with thee,</hi> Light and Salvation reach'd her Soul together with the Voice; yet the manner of acting was different, for the one was done by Command, as by a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154273:107"/> the other Praying and Begging, as by a most Holy Creature. Whence you may gather, how much it imports us that this Blessed Lady should be our Advocate, and that we have a special De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards her, since her Words are so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Salvation, and they are not of less Value now in Heaven than they were upon Earth.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Blessed Virgin being return'd home, the Holy <hi>Joseph</hi> perceiving her to be with Child, and not knowing how it came to pass, the Holy Evaneglist says, That he being unwilling to accuse her, thought to go away and forsake her, till the Angel of God appear'd to him in a Dream, and reveal'd to him this great Mystery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here first consider how much the Blessed Virgin endur'd at this time, seeing her Beloved Consort in so much Affliction and Trouble, and that with so much Cause; that by this you may perceive how sometimes our Lord seems to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his Elect, and tries them with great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Tribulations, by this means to exercise their Faith, Hope, Charity, Humility, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which Virtues encrease and are perfected by these Afflictions, even as Gold is try'd by Fire, and the Fire lighted by the Air.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:154273:107"/>3. Consider also with how great Patience and Silence the Holy Virgin suffer'd this Affliction, since it neither caus'd her to lose her Peace of Conscience, nor the Humility of her Soul, nor to discover the Secret of that Mystery; tho' she could have brought such good Proofs of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, as were St. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Sanctity and Innocency of her own Life, to free her from Blemish. She us'd no such means, but having recourse to Prayer, recommended her self and her Cause to God, wholly referring her self to his Divine Providence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider also the greatness of her Faith and Hope, since in so intricate an Affair (which no Human Wisdom could resolve) she was so far from desponding, that she assuredly confided her Relief would come from him that produc'd the Mystery, and that the Author of the one would be Author of the other, because the Works of our Lord are in no part defective, but absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all Points. By these Considerations you may come to understand the truth of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the Prophet spoke, <hi>Many are the Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Just, but the Lord will deliver them from them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider likewise the Sanctity of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Patriarch, who having so great an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Accuse and Condemn the Innocent, and having the Power of Life, by the Law, in his own Hands, yet would not stain them with an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation which he believ'd Just, but would rather expose himself to wander thro' the World, than prosecute the Law in his own Right. For true Justice is always full of Mercy, and true Charity never looks upon that as Gain, which is got by the Loss of another. By this you may perceive
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154273:108"/> how familiar the Vertue of Mercy is to the Just, and with how much Reason <hi>Ecclesiasticas</hi> said, <hi>That the Just Man had compassion even of Beasts, but that the Bowels of the Wicked were cruel.</hi> This seems not to have been the Work of Man, but of an Angel. For it is the part of Devils to do harm to those, who do not deserve it, and of Men to them that do; but it is the property of Angels not to hurt even those that deserve it. Such was this Blessed new Angel upon Earth, tho' in truth the Blessed Virgin was so clear from any Offence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Next consider the Revelation made to this Holy Patriarch, that thus you may understand how our Lord Chastizes, Cherishes, Mortifies, gives Life, and casts Down into the profound A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss, and then raises thence; and in short, that what the Apostle says is certain, to wit, <hi>The Lord knows well how to deliver the Just from Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Then you have a good Subject to consider how great Joy and Admiration must possess the Saint, when he found Innocence where he so earnestly desir'd it, and not only Innocence to move him not to forsake her, but so much Glory and Dignity to cause him to respect her. What Thanks, what Praises did he give to God for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so Enlightned, so Undeceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, so Comforted him, so taken him off from his vain Thoughts, and Purposes, and chosen him to be the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of so great a Treasure? We may imagine how he went presently to the most Holy Virgin (who was then doubtless at her Morning Prayers, begging relief of God in that Affliction) and with what Tears and Devotion he cast himself at her Feet, and begg'd Pardon for his past Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; how he gave her an Account of what the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154273:108"/> Angel had reveal'd to him; and what Joy the Blessed Virgin then Conceiv'd, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nsidering on the one Hand the secure Assistance God gives to his Elect in their Troubles and on the other seeing her Holy Consort deliver'd from his Anguish, and his Sorrow turn'd into Joy; for his Grief must be an Affliction to her, because of the Love she bore him. For tho', as to the Use of Matrimony, she knew him not as a Husband, yet never Marry'd Woman bore her Husband the like Conjugal Love and Respect. And if (as <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith) the Mercy of God is Beautiful in the time of Tribulation, what Sense must they then have of the Beauty of this Mercy, at a time of so great Tribulation? What <hi>Matins</hi> did they both Offer up? What <hi>Laudes</hi> did they Sing? And with what abundance of Tears was this Office Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and a Thanksgiving Offer'd up for this Mercy?</p>

Do thou then, Christian Brother, travel along with them; that so being their Companion in the Journey and Suffering, thou may'st after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards partake of the Joy and Glory of the Mystery.</hi>

               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4. Next, consider the extreme Poverty and Humility the King of Heaven made choice of in this World for his Birth; a poor House, a poor Bed, a poor Mother, poor Moveables, and such poor Necessaries, that the greatest part of what was there us'd was not only poor and mean, but also (as S.</hi> Bernard <hi>says) borrow'd, and borrow'd from Beasts. Such was the Lodging the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven made choice of, and such the Pampering and Cherishment of that Sacred Lying-in.</hi> O Lord our God, (<hi>saith S.</hi> Cyprian) how admirable is thy Name throughout the Earth!
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:154273:110"/> Thou art truly a God working Wonders. I do not admire at the Figure of the World, or at the Stability of the Earth, tho' it be near so moveable a Heaven; nor at the Succession of Days; nor at the Changes of Times, wherein some things wither, others spring up, some die, and others come to life. I wonder at none of these things, but I am astonish'd to see God in the Womb of a Virgin, to see the Almighty in a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to see how Flesh could be united to the Word of God; and how God being a Spiritual Substance, took upon him a Corporeal Cloathing. I am astonish'd at the Cost, Manner, and Distance of Time, that interven'd in this Work. This Affair might have been much sooner concluded; and the World might have been Sav'd with one Word of Christ, since with one Word it was Created. By this it appears, how much more Noble a Creature Rational Man is, than all this Corporeal World, since so much more was expended for his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.

                  <hi>Lord, I heard thy Words, and I fear'd; I consider'd thy Works, and was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd.</hi> With reason thou art astonish'd, holy Prophet, for what is more astonishing than what the Evangelist relates in so few words; saying, <hi>She brought forth her only Son, and wrapped him up in poor Clouts, and laid him in a Manger, because she had no other place in the Inn.</hi> O Mystery of profound Veneration! O Wonder not to be express'd, but to be felt; not to be explain'd with Words, but to be admir'd with Silence! What can be more worthy Admiration, than to see that Lord whom the Morning-Stars Praise, him who sits upon
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:154273:110"/> Cherubs, who flies upon the Wings of the Winds, who poises the Globe of the Earth on three Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whose Seat is Heaven, and whose Footstool is the Earth; that he should descend to such a degree of Poverty, as that when he was Born, (since he would be Born in this World) his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should lay him in a Manger, because she had no other place in that Inn? What mean Person has been reduc'd to such great Poverty, to lay a Child in a Manger, for want of a better Place? How came two so distant Extreams to be brought together, as God and a Manger? What is more mean than a Manger, which belongs to Beasts; and what so sublime as God, whose Seat is upon the Cherubs? How can Man consider these two distant Extreams, and not stand astonish'd; God in a Manger, God in a Stable, God Crying, Quaking with Cold, and Wrapped in Blankets? O King of Glory! O Mirror of Innocency, what hast thou to do with these Cares, what with Tears, what with Cold, Nakedness, the Tribute, and the Punishment of our Sins? O Incomprehensible Charity, Goodness, and Mercy of our God! What shall I do, my God? What Thanks shall I give thee? How shall I answer so many Mercies? With what Humility shall I answer such Humility? With what Love such Love? And with what Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude so great a Benefit? I am so beset on all sides with Obligations, I am as it were drown'd in Benefits, and see not how to be eased of so great a Burden. Before I thought he deserved a thousand Hells who offended thee; but now after so many and great Benefits, I think no Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great enough for him who does not love thee.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> Blessed be thou for ever, my God, who hast so bound me to thee, and hast so drawn my Heart
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154273:111"/> to thee, and hast bestowed such Favours and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, to enflame me in thy Love, and confirm me in thy Hope; and to make me love Sufferings, Poverty, Humility, the Contempt of the World, and the Embracing of the Cross.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6.</hi> But let us a little turn our Eyes from the Manger, and let us look upon the Treasure that lies in it; let us leave the Wax-mould, and endeavour to taste the Honey that is in it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then the unspeakable Sweetness and Mercy of our Saviour; which particularly Exerts it self in this Tender Age, and this Infant Figure that outwardly appears to us. God hangs at the Breast of a Virgin, <hi>(says a Saint)</hi> he is swathed with Rowlers, and stretches out his Hands and Feet in that narrow Bed. He Smiles as a Child upon his Mother, he Fawns upon her, and turns his pleasant Eyes to behold her. And tho' he be an Abyss of Sweetness, the Tenderness of his Limbs renders him here yet Sweeter. This Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Incomparable, and this Goodness Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible; to see the God that made me become a Child for my sake; and of whom formerly it was said, God is Great, and most Worthy of Praise; now it is said, God is Little, and very Amiable.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7.</hi> Having thus beheld the Son, let us then look upon the Mother, who bears not the least part in this Mystery. Consider then this Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin's Joy, her Devotion, her Tears and Diligence; and ponder how perfectly she here perform'd both the Parts of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Behold how solicitous and carefully she attends upon the Child; how she takes him in her Arms, Opens, Swathes, Binds, Embraces, Adores, Kisses, and Suckles him. All this Mystery is full of Joy; for in that Holy Birth there was nothing Undecent, or Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154273:111"/> There was no need (<hi>saith S.</hi> Cyprian) of Bathing or Washing, as is usual with other Women, because the Mother of our Saviour had suffered no Detriment; for she Brought forth without Pain, as she had Conceiv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pleasure. The ripe Fruit fell from the Tree that bore it; and there was no need of Gathering that, which of its own accord Offer'd it self. This Birth was liable to no Penalty, nor did the foregoing Pleasure, (for there was none) merit any Return of Sorrow. Therefore it was not requisite, that she who was Innocent, should suffer without Cause; nor would Divine Justice permit that Repository of the Holy Ghost to suffer the Detriment of other Women; since she only did partake of their Nature, not of their Guilt. Tho' the Furniture that was wanting had been there, yet it had been unregarded; for the Presence of the Infant, had so taken up the Eyes and Attention of the holy <hi>Joseph,</hi> and of all there present, that that in him alone appear'd to be the Compliment of all Bliss; and there was no need of Begging that Piecemeal, which was all contain'd in that Almighty Infant. But it is not to be believ'd, that the Ministry of Angels was there wanting, nor the Presence of the Holy Ghost, which had descended upon the Virgin. There he was, there he Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd the Palace, there he Adorn'd the Temple which he had Dedicated for himself; and Kept his Tabernacle, Honour'd that Virgin-Bridal-Chamber, rejoic'd that Blessed Soul with wonderful Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and remov'd from it all the Distraction of Worldly Thoughts; so that the Law of the Flesh did not oppose that of the Spirit, nor did any manner of Reluctancy disturb the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of her Heart. The Infant Sucking in his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154273:112"/> Mothers Arms, enjoyed that Milk provided by Heaven, and the Fountain of that Sacred Breast infus'd most pure Liquor into the Mouth of the Child. <hi>Thus far are the Words of S.</hi> Cyprian.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>8. After all this, thou may'st also lift up thy Thoughts to consider on the one hand, the Singing of the Angels, and on the other, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Shepherds, Praising our Lord with the former, and Adoring him with the latter. For if the Angels flock together, and so devoutly Praise our Lord, and give him Thanks for this Redemption which came from Heaven; tho' it is not they who are Redeem'd; if they return such Praises for the Grace and Mercy bestow'd upon others, what ought he to do who was Redeem'd and Restor'd by it.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Circumcision of our Lord.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>EIght Days being pass'd after the Nativity,</hi> (the Evangelist says) <hi>the Child was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and call'd Jesus; which Name was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Angel, before he was Conceived in the Womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here you may first consider, what Pain that most tender Flesh endur'd by this Martyrdom; which was so great (especially the Eighth Day) that some Dy'd of it. By which thou may'st per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how great thy Debt is to our Lord, who so early began to suffer such violent Pains, and to do such hard Penance for thy foul Crimes. Behold, how the First Day of his Birth he shed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154273:112"/> Tears, and the Eighth Blood, to shew thee, that Christ's Charity decays not, but that Man Daily cost him more and more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Think also upon the Sorrow and Tears of the Holy <hi>Joseph,</hi> who so tenderly Lov'd this Child, but much more those of his Blessed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who Lov'd him better without Comparison; and consider what Care she us'd to Hush and Quiet the Child, who like a Real Child, though True God, Cry'd; and with what Reverence she gather'd those holy Relicks, and that Precious Blood, whose Value she so well knew.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider likewise how late the Son of God began to Preach, and how soon to Suffer, for at Thirty Years of Age he began his Preaching, and the Eighth Day he Suffer'd the Circumcision, and began the Work of our Redemption. Behold how that Spouse of Blood begins already to shed Blood for his Spouse the Church; and how the Second <hi>Adam</hi> being come forth from the Paradice of the Virgin-Womb, begins, like one of us, to know Good and Evil. Observe, how that Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and Redeemer of Mankind, begins already to give Earnest of the Payment he is to make, shedding at present this Small Quantity of Blood, as a Pledge of that Vast Quantity he shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pour forth. By this you may perceive with what Eager Desires he comes into the World, since he so Early begins to give this Treasure for Man. Adore then, O my Soul, Adore and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship this Precious Drop of Blood, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the whole Price of thy Redemption, for that alone was sufficient to have Sav'd us, had not the Superabundant Mercy of God been pleas'd to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie so plentifully for our Sins.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:154273:113"/>5. Reflect likewise, how this Day he is Nam'd <hi>Jesus,</hi> (that is to say, Saviour) that if the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance shown of a Sinner should discourage thee, thou may'sft be strengthen'd by this most Holy and Powerful Name of a Saviour. Praise then, O my Soul, Embrace and Kiss this most sweet Name, sweeter than Honey, more soft than Oyl, more healing than Balsam, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than all the Powers in the World. This is the Name which the Patriarchs wish'd for, which the Prophets sigh'd after, and which the Psalms, and all the Generations of the World repeated and sang Praises to. This is the Name the Angels adore, the Devils fear, from which the Adverse Powers fly, and by whose Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sinners are Sav'd. O sweet Name, melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, glorious Name, who were so happy as to bear thee always written in Characters of Gold upon his Heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now then, frail and distrustful Man, if the Tenderness of the New-Born Infant was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent enough to draw thee to him, let the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Efficacy of this Holy Name prevail, that thou may'st not fly from him. Approach confidently to him, and say with the most devout <hi>Anselm, O Jesus, for the Honour of thy Holy Name, be thou to me Jesus.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>AMong the Wonders that hapned on the Day of our Saviour's Birth, one was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 2.</note>
                  <hi>that a new Star appear'd in the East, signifying the new Light that was come to the World, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten those that liv'd in Darkness, and in the Region and Shadow of Death. Certain Wise Men, who liv'd in those Parts, by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of the Holy Ghost, understanding what that Star signify'd, set out immediately to Adore that Lord, and being come to</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>ask'd for the place of his Birth, saying, Where is he that is Born King of the</hi> Jews? <hi>And having there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd information of the place of his Birth, and being guided by the same Star they had seen in the East, they came to</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and there found the Child in his Mother's Arms, and falling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate on the Ground, they Ador'd him, and Offered their Gifts, which were, Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh.</hi> Here you may plainly perceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Goodness and Charity of our Lord, who was scarce Born into the World, when he began to make the World partake of his Splendor and Riches, drawing to him, by the light of his Star, those Men from such distant Countries, that hereby you may understand, that he will not fly from those who carefully seek after him, who so sedulously sought after those who so little thought of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here you may first consider the Devotion, Perseverence, Faith, and Offering of these Holy
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154273:114"/> Men, for in every one of these Particulars, there is much Subject for Meditation and Imitation: Consider then first the greatness of their Devotion, which made them undertake so great a Journey with so much Trouble and Danger, to come to Adore our Lord, and Enjoy a Sight of him; that thou may'st hereby Condemn thy own Sloth, seeing for how small trouble thou often dost neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect enjoying this Happiness, neglecting to repair to the House of God, where thou might'st see this Lord, and enjoy his Presence, and even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into thy Soul, by means of the Holy Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reflect also upon their great Constancy and Perseverance, since tho' forsaken by the Heavenly Guide, yet they were not discourag'd, nor turn'd back, but resolutely continu'd their Journey, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their best Endeavours, when the Heavenly Assistance fail'd. Here we have a great Example not to faint, or grow slack in our Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, when the Light of Devotion, and the Joy of Inward Sweetness forsakes us, but rather to endeavour to proceed, still continuing our Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, using our best Endeavours, and confidently believing, that the Light of Consolation which we saw at first, will visit us again, by our Lord's Command, as the Star did to those Holy Men, according to that of the Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who says, <hi>He hides the Light in his Hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 36.</note>
                  <hi>and Commands it to rise again, thereby declaring to his Friends, that he is their Possession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider likewise the great Faith of these Holy Men, since entring into so poor a Room, and seeing no Kingly Robes, or Furniture, yet they doubted not but that was the Lord and King of all the Creation, and therefore falling Prostrate
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154273:114"/> on the Ground, they Ador'd him with profound Reverence. Great was the Faith of the good Thief, who amidst the Injuries of the Cross, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd the Kingdom of him that was Crucify'd; so was also the Faith of these Holy Men great, seeing they Ador'd and Own'd the Divinity and Majesty, amidst so great Poverty and Humility. O Wonderful Infancy, whose Swadling-clouts are Watch'd by Angels, Attended by Stars, Fear'd by Kings, and Worship'd on the Ground by the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Wisdom. O happy Cottage, O Seat of the Almighty, next to Heaven, where not lighted Flambeaux, but bright Stars shine. O Heavenly Palace, where lives, not a Crown'd King, but a God Incarnate, whose Throne is a Manger, and whose Gilded Palace is a Smoaky Cottage, yet Adorned and Enlightned with Celestial Rays.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It remains next to View the Offering made by these Holy Men, in pursuance of their Faith, acknowledging that Faith must not go Naked and Alone, but Accompany'd with Good Works. And considering more profoundly the Mystery of this Offering, we shall find, that in it is represented to us the Sum of all Christian Justice. For there are Three principal things Comprehended by this Justice: The First is for a Man to perform his Duty towards God: The Second towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And the Third towards his Neighbour: And he performs all these Parts, who Spiritually Offers, what these holy Men Offer'd. For by the Frankincense is understood Prayer, which is a Work of the Virtue call'd Religion, to which it belongs to Honour and Adore God. Wherefore the Prophet said; <hi>Let my Prayer ascend, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 130.</note>
                  <hi>like Incense.</hi> For as the Incense ascends on high with Sweetness of Odour, so Prayer ascends from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154273:115"/> Earth to Heaven, and is acceptable to God. But by Myrrh, which is very Bitter, but Wholsom, and Odoriferous, is signify'd the Mortification of our Appetites, and Affections, which is very Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our Flesh▪ yet very Wholsom and Sweet to our Spirit. By the Gold, Charity is Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; for as Gold is the most Precious of all Metals, so Charity is the most Excellent of all Virtues. Now according to this, he who would do his Duty towards God, must Offer up Incense; that is, a Devout Heart always lifted up from Earth to Heaven by Meditation, and a Continual Remembrance of God's Holy Name; for this is Offering of Incense, whose Odour always ascends on high. But he that would do his Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himself, let him Offer Myrrh of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Chastizing his Flesh, Bridling his Tongue, Recollecting his Thoughts, and Mortifying all his Appetites: For this is Myrrh of a most Sweet Odour before God, tho' it be Bitter and Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Flesh. Now he that would also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Duty towards his Neighbour, must Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Gold of Charity, dividing what he has among the Needy, bearing with, and charitably forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such as are Offensive, and treating all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lovingly. So that he who would be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Christian, must labour always to have Three Hearts in One; one for God, another for himself, and another for his Neighbour; that is, a most Devout and Humble Heart towards God; another very Harsh and Severe towards himself; and a third most Bountiful and Loving towards his Neighbour. Blessed is he that Adores the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Unity, and blessed is he who has these Three sorts of Hearts in One.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:154273:115"/>6. After this you may consider the great Joy the Blessed Virgin doubtless Conceiv'd at this Passage, seeing the Faith and Devotion of these Holy Men, lifting up her Heart to the Hopes those first Offerings promis'd; and seeing this new Testimony of the Glory of her Son, over and above chose she had receiv d before; which were, his being a Son without a Father; her being a Virgin and Mother at the same time; her Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth without Pain; the Singing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the Adoration of the Shepherds; and now the Offering of such great Men, coming from the Remote Parts of the World. How great then must be the Joy of her Soul? How many the Tears that flow'd from her Eyes? How extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary the Exultation and Ardency of her Heart? Especially considering that the Knowledge of God began already to Reign in the World; that the Church began to be Founded; and all the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that had been Prophesy'd, to be fulfill'd. Now how great must her Joy be at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this Glorious Work, since she so earnestly Thirsted after the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls? If her Soul so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoic'd at the Promise of these Wonders, how great must her delight be for these happy Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and Pledges of what was to ensue?</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Forty Days prescrib'd by the Law (for the Purification of a Woman that brought forth) being expir'd,</hi> the Evangelist says, <hi>the Blessed Virgin went to</hi> Jerusalem <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil this Law, and Offer up her Holy Infant in the Temple, where he was receiv'd in the Arms of the Holy</hi> Simeon, <hi>who so long had expected this Day; and where he was also Known and Ador'd by that Holy Widow</hi> Anna, <hi>who at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here thou may'st first Consider the most profound Humility of the Virgin, who being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bringing forth more Pure than the Stars of Heaven, yet did not disdain to submit her self to the Law of Purification, and to Offer Sacrifice which belong'd to Unclean Women. By this you may perceive how different the Proceedings of the Mother and the Son are from ours. For we would be Sinners, and not seem so; but Christ and his Mother are not Sinners, and yet do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to appear such: For the Son after Eight Days submitted to the Law of Circumcision, which was the Token of a Sinner; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after Forty Days, submitted her self to the Law of Purification, which was the Sacrifice of Unclean Women.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider also the Humility and Charity of the Son of God, who this Day Offer'd up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:154273:116"/> for us in the Temple, and Deliver'd himself up as our most Precious Offering, in the sight of his Father, that we might have this new Merit to Plead in all our Petitions, and Pretentions, as is the having Offer'd up on our behalf a Daily Offering, so Precious a Gift. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son you may Consider with how Good-will the Blessed Virgin Offer'd up this her First-begotten, and only Son, to the Eternal Father, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World; as one that was so full of Charity, so desirous of the Redemption of Man, and so well understood the Value of the Offering that was made. But it is much more worthy our Consideration, with how much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness and Joy the same First-begotten Son of God Offer'd up himself to his Eternal Father, for the Redemption of Man; as one who so Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lov'd, and so Earnestly Sought their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since for them he Descended from Heaven to Earth; for them he took upon him Human Flesh; to seek them he spent Thirty-three Years in this World; for them he dy'd on a Cross; and their Conversion and Salvation, he said, was his Food and Sustenance; and he declar'd the earnest Desire he had of their Salvation by the great Thirst he endur'd on the Cross. Now judge with how Good-will did he Offer up himself here to his Father for the Redemption of Mankind, who so earnestly Lov'd them, and Desir'd their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Other Fathers, being reduc'd to Extremity of Want, Sell their Children, and even some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Kill them for their Support, but this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Father of the World to come, who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to us from Heaven, Delivers and Offers up himself for the Life of his Children.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:154273:117"/>4. Reflect also, how the Holy Virgin joins to this Inestimable Offering another of such small Value, as were those Birds the Law prescrib'd; that hereby thou may'st learn to join thy poor Good Works to those of Christ; to the end, that through the Value and Merit of his, thine may be accepted. The Ivy of it self ascends not on high, but being planted against a Tree, it ascends as high as the Tree. So also ascends the Meanness of our Works, when supported by this Tree of Life plac'd in the midst of the Paradice of the Church, which is Christ our Saviour. Join then thy Prayers to his, thy Tears to his, thy Fasting and Watching to his, and so Offer them to our Lord; that what in it self is of no Price, through him may become of great Value. One Drop of Water taken by it self, is but Water, yet being cast into a great Bowl of Wine, it takes a Nobler Being, and becomes VVine: So our VVorks, which as being ours are worth Little, being join'd to those of Christ, become of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Value, by reason of the Grace we receive through him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Observe likewise, that the Offering was of Birds, and those such Birds, as Moan instead of Singing; to the end, hereby thou may'st under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the Life of the Just in this Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consists only in Bemoaning and Flying; for of the one follows the other, because the Sorrow of Repentance follows the Flight of Meditation. How can he who always considers the Absence of God, the Misery of this World, the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this Banishment, and the Sins, Dangers, and Deceits of this Life, how can he chuse but live in continual Sorrow? How can he chuse but say with the Prophet, <hi>My Tears were my Food
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:154273:117"/> Day and Night, whilest they say unto my Soul, Where is thy God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Next consider the Greatness of the Joy conceiv'd by the Holy <hi>Simeon</hi> at the Sight of this Infant, which was beyond what can be express'd. For what could be the Sense of this Blessed Man, (who was so Zealous of God's Glory, and for the Salvation of Souls, and who so earnestly desir'd before his Dissolution to behold him, whom all the Holy Patriarchs so eagerly wish'd for, and in whose Coming consisted the Redemption of all Generations) What could be the Sense of his Heart, when he beheld this Infant, receiv'd him into his Arms; and understood by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in that little Body was contain'd all the Majesty of God, and when he saw with such a Son such a Mother? What could he think, seeing Two such Heavenly Lights, and being given to understand such Wonderful Things? What could he say? What could he imagine? VVhat a Sight was it to behold the Tears that distilled from his Eyes? The Alteration of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? And the Devotion wherewith he Sang that most sweet Canticle, which contains the substance of the Gospel? <hi>O Lord, how happy are those who Love and Serve thee! How well bestow'd are their Labours, since they are so well Requited and Rewarded, even in this World, before they receive the Recompence of the Life to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. After thou hast thus consider'd the Affections of this Holy Man, endeavour to look into the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin's Heart; and you will find her on the one hand full of unspeakable Joy and Admiration, hearing the Wonders that were foretold of her Son: And on the other, opprest with excessive
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:154273:118"/> Sorrow mix'd with this Joy; hearing the Sad News the same Holy Man foretold to the Infant, saying, He should be as it were the Mark, at which the World and all Carnal Men should aim the Darts of their Rage, and should offer him all the Contradiction they could, which should pierce the Holy Virgin's Heart with a sharp Sword of Sorrow. VVhy wouldst thou, O Lord, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit so Dismal a Discovery to be made so early, to thy most Innocent Spouse, that it might be a Torment and Martyrdom to her whilst she liv'd? VVhy could not this Mystery have been conceal'd till the Time it was to happen, that she might then only suffer the Martyrdom, and not all her Life-time? Why art thou not satisfi'd, O Lord, that she should be always a Virgin, but that she must also be always a Martyr? VVhy dost thou Afflict her thou so entirely Lovest? Her who hath so faithfully Serv'd thee? And her who never did any thing that might deserve Punishment? Certainly, O Lord, therefore thou Afflictest, because thou Lovest her; that she may not be depriv'd of the Merit of Patience, of the Glory of this Martyrdom, of the Exercise of this Virtue, of Imitating Christ, and of the Reward of Sufferings; which by how much the greater they are, by so much the greater is the Crown of Glory they merit. Let no Man then speak ill of Sufferings, let none hate the Cross, let none think he is out of God's Favour, when he is Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; since she who was Favour'd and Lov'd above all Creatures, was the most Depress'd and Afflicted.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>AFter the Holy Wise Men were return'd home by another Way, (as they had been advis'd by an Angel</hi>) Herod <hi>seeing himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as having no News of the Infant, resolv'd to Murder all the Children that were in the Land of</hi> Bethlehem; <hi>that among them he might destroy him he sought after. Then the Angel appearing to</hi> Joseph <hi>in a Dream, order'd him to take the Child and his Mother, and to fly with them into the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>because</hi> Herod <hi>sought the Child that he might Kill him. He rising by Night, took the Child and his Mother, and went away into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and there he staid Seven Years, till the Death of</hi> Herod; <hi>after which he was again admonished by the Angel to return into the Land of</hi> Israel; <hi>for that they were now Dead who sought the Death of the Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here thou maist consider what a Fright this put the Virgin into, after all her late Joys, seeing a powerful King sought after the Child she so entirely Lov'd, to Kill him; how diligently she went about to secure that Precious Treasure; and what Tears of Compassion she shed all the way she went, upon the Infant's Face, whom she carried in her Arms; seeing the Doleful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Holy <hi>Simeon</hi> began already to be Fulfill'd, to wit, of the Persecutions and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles her Son was to go through. Consider how readily she arose and laid hold of the Child, and how little she delay'd to leave her Country, her Kindred, her Friends, and her House, to secure
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:154273:119"/> that which was so incomparably to be valued above them all. And observe what Hardships these Holy Travellers must endure in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate and dangerous Journey; especially being so ill provided, as well by reason of their Poverty, as their Haste in Setting out: But above all, what their Sufferings must be, during that Seven Years Banishment in a Country of Heathens and Idolaters, where there was but little Charity or Humanity towards Strangers, because the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives even among themselves were Barbarous and Inhuman. The Blessed Virgin's Poverty was such, that for want of a Lamb on the Day of her Purification, she Offer'd a Pair of Turtle-Doves, which was the Offering of the Poor. There then they liv'd, as poor Strangers, with little Accommodation, ill Lodg'd, and Slighted by all the VVorld; yet with Content, and Joyful, because their Treasure was in Safety. By this thou maist understand how our Lord Treats his Friends in this VVorld; how he Afflicts, Tries and Exercises them in this Life, that he may Cherish and Crown them in the next.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Observe also how early our Lord began to suffer Banishment, Persecutions, and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this VVorld, that hereby those who are Members of his Body, and partake of his Spirit, may understand, that they must expect no less from the VVorld, than their Lord himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Observe the Cruelty of this wicked King, who could find in his Heart to shed so much Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood; by which you will discover, how dismal and destructive are the Effects of the Vices of Ambition and Covetousness; since they so far prevail'd with this Cruel Tyrant, as to make him
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:154273:119"/> Destroy so many Children only to come at him, who he fear'd might lessen his Power. Learn thou then, Christian Brother, by this Example, to shun all Worldly Honours, and to despise false and deceitful Riches; lest they prove to thee the Occasion of the like Enormities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider also, that Christ was scarce Born, when there arose a <hi>Herod</hi> to Kill him. Whence you may infer, that Christ will scarce be Born in thy Heart, when presently there will rise many <hi>Herods</hi> to destroy him: For presently the World with its Persecutions, the Flesh with its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, False Friends with Evil Counsels, and the Devil with all his Artifices, will all labour to break thy Good Purposes; which is the same thing, as to Destroy Christ New-Born in thee.<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> Fly then at that Time, with that Holy Woman in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> to the Desart, that is, to Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and shun the Company of Men, especially those who may Distract thee. Observe, that Christ was safer in <hi>Egypt</hi> than in <hi>Jury;</hi> that is, safer amongst Infidels, than among the Faithful: For sometimes a Christian is safer amongst Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than among Carnal and Wicked Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For a Professed Enemy is less dangerous than a Private Traitor; and the Wolf does less harm in his own Figure, than when disguis'd with a Sheep-skin. Wherefore the Apostle says; <hi>I writ to you one Epistle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note>
                  <hi>advising that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse not with Carnal Men and Fornicators; do not think I speak of the Fornicators of this World, but that if any one of these, who have the Name of Brothers, be a Fornicator, or Unclean, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, you separate your selves from him; and that in such manner, that you sit not down so much as to Eat with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:154273:120"/>6. Our Saviour being now arriv'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> think it not much to join thy self to that Holy Company in that Solitude they endur'd for thy Sake, promising always faithfully to Accompany them; for sometimes thou wilt Merit no less by Accompanying them with Pious Meditations, than if thou did'st bodily Attend on them. The Scripture doth not mention what they did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but thou of thy self may'st frame many Considerations on our Saviour's Infancy, that may move thee to Devotion. In the same manner, imagine thou. Travellest with them every Day's Journey, when they return to their own City. Sometimes assist them, as occasion offers, on the Way; other whiles Discourse with the Mother concerning her Sweet Son; and other times Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Beautiful Infant, and beg of him to make thee his own, and give thee his Blessing. This Entertainment will soften thy Heart, and thy Familiarity with the true Son of Justice will enlighten and warm thy Devotion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In fine, after Seven Years, <hi>Herod</hi> being dead, the Child and his Mother return'd to their Country: By which thou may'st perceive, that the Prosperity of the Wicked, and the Adversity of the Just, is short; only with this Difference, that the Prosperity of the former begets everlasting Sorrow, and the Adversity of the latter produces everlasting Joy.

               <head type="sub">How the Infant <hi>Jesus</hi> was lost, and afterwards found again in the Temple. The Fifth Joyful Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Child being now Twelve Years old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and his Parents coming up to</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>according to the Custom of the Solemnity, the Child</hi> Jesus <hi>remain'd in the Temple, without their knowledge. And when they had missed him, and sought him Three Days with great Grief, at length they found him in the Temple, sitting among the Doctors, Hearing and Answering them Wisely, and Astonishing them with the Greatness of his Wisdom, and the Profoundness of his Answers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here thou may'st consider the excessive Grief the Blessed Virgin endur'd for this Accident. For the better understanding whereof, it is to be observ'd, that Three Passions sway'd the Heart of this Holy Virgin, which were so great and admirable, that they exceed all what we are capable of comprehending. The First was, the great Love she bore her Son; for in her concurr'd all the Causes of Love that can be imagin'd, and all of them in the highest Degree of Perfection. For there is Natural Love, Love of Grace, and Love of Justice. Her Natural Love was the greatest that ever had been, or ever will be; because it was the Love of a Mother to an only Son, which is the greatest Love King <hi>David</hi> could think on, when he would express his Love towards his Friend <hi>Jonathan,</hi> saying, <hi>As the Mother
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:154273:121"/> loves the only Son she has, so I loved thee.</hi> Now this was the Love of a Mother to her only Son; yet such a sort of Mother without a Father, and such a Son there never was, nor ever will be. Now as to the Love of Grace, there never was, not ever will be any greater in this World; because no Pure Creature had ever a like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Grace with the Blessed Virgin, and proportionable to her Grace she had a Measure of Love and Charity towards him. The Third Sort of Love, which we call of Justice, which is that which is due to the Lov'd Object, on account of its Perfections, was, as well as the rest, the greatest that could be. Because the Beloved was not only the Son of the Virgin, but also the Son of God; Infinitely Perfect, and consequently wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be Infinitely Lov'd, if it were possible. For if the greater the Perfection of a Son is, the greater Love he deserves, how much did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, who was Infinitely Perfect? Now how great an Inundation must these Three great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Love overflowing produce? How great a Conflagration be rais'd, by the Uniting of these Three fierce Flames, to wit, Natural Love, Love of Grace, and Love of Justice; that is, the Love of God, the Love of a Son, and the Love of such a Son? This is not to be expressed by any Tongue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Second Passion, which is a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the First, is, the great Joy the Blessed Virgin must be fill'd with, for enjoying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of such a Son: For Joy proceeds from the Presence and Fruition of the Lov'd Object; so that the greater the Love, the greater the Joy. Now if the Love she bore such a Son was so great, how great must the Joy be which she
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:154273:121"/> conceiv'd for having him continually near her; for seeing him daily at her Table, for hearing his Discourse, for enjoying his Presence, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Divine Countenance; those Eyes, that Staidness, and that Majesty which appear'd in so little a Body? How often is it likely she sat at Table without Eating, beholding him Eat who Feeds the Angels? How often may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine she spent whole Nights kneeling by his Bed-side, seeing how he Slept, who Watches to Preserve the World? If only the Memory of this Lord was sufficient to awake the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> in the Night, when he said, <hi>My Soul, O Lord, desired thee in the Night.</hi> And if we read of some Saints, that when they Contemplated the Perfections and Beauty of this Lord, they were Rapt in Spirit, and wholly Alienated from their Senses, and Lifted up in the Air; as is written of St. <hi>Antony.</hi> the Hermit, St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> and many others; what can we then think of her, who had so much more Grace and Charity than all the Saints, and who had so near her the Holy of Holies? What Motions must she feel in her Heart? What Joy, what Raptures must she be sensible of? Is there any Tongue that can Express it? By this we may give a guess at the Nature of the Third Passion, which proceeds from these Two, and is the Excessive Sorrow the Blessed Virgin must conceive, when she found her self depriv'd of so great a Treasure; especially remembring the Prophecies of the Holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> the Persecution of <hi>Herod,</hi> the Death of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children, her Banishment into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Fear of <hi>Archelaus;</hi> for all these things threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great Sufferings to ensue. It is writ of the Mother of <hi>Tobias,</hi> that because her Son tarry'd
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:154273:122"/> too long in the Journey he had undertaken, she shed comfortless Tears, saying, <hi>Why did we send thee to Travel, thou Staff of our Old Age, Light of our Eyes, Hope of our Posterity, and Comfort of our Life?</hi> Now if that Mother so bitterly Lamented, what must we think was the Sorrow of this? What comparison is there betwixt the Mothers, or betwixt the Sons; betwixt their Treasures, and betwixt their Losses. As much Difference as is betwixt them, the same is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Sorrows. What can we imagine the Blessed Virgin did, during this Time? What can we think of her Tears, her Sighs, her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, her Prayers? Can we believe she Eat, she Drank, or clos'd her Eyes to Sleep, till she found him her Soul lov'd? It is likely she said, <hi>My Son, why hast thou forsaken me? Where canst thou be? Where dost thou Eat? Where dost thou Sleep? Where dost thou take thy Rest? O most Sweet Lamb, how could'st thou pierce thy Mother's Heart with such bitter Sorrow?</hi> Three Days Interval was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the Command, to Sacrifice his Son; that during this time he might be sensible of the Grief he must conceive at the Remembrance of the Death of so Dear a Son; the same space was allotted this most Loving Mother, to endure the Pain his sad Absence must produce in her. O Lord, why dost thou Afflict those thou Lovest? How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful art thou to furnish them with Subject of Merit, and Reward; giving them so many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to Suffer, to Pray, to Fear, to Hope, to Humble themselves, and to have Recourse to thee in all their Afflictions?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next to the Blessed Virgin's Sorrow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with what Diligence and Care she sought
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:154273:122"/> the Jewel she had lost, and enquir'd after it in all Places. The Evangelist particularly mentions, that she sought him among her Kindred and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that by this thou may'st understand, that Christ is not to be found among the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Delights of Flesh and Blood, but in the Renunciation and Mortification of all these Blandishments. <hi>To whom</hi> (says the Prophet) <hi>shall God Teach his Wisdom?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay 62.</note>
                  <hi>To whom shall he Reveal his Mysteries? To them that are Weaned from Milk, and to those that are removed from: the Breasts.</hi> Therefore it is said to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King: <hi>Hear, Daughter, and see,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 44.11.</note>
                  <hi>and incline thy Ear; and forget thy People, and the House of thy Father. And the King will covet thy Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Now she not finding the Child among her Kindred, return'd, to seek him, to the Temple whence she came, where she found him among the Doctors of the Law, Hearing and Proposing Wise Questions to them, to the great Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that were present; and there she said to him, <hi>Son, why hast thou done so by us? Behold thy Father and I have sought thee with Sorrow.</hi> Thou then who seekest after the lost Infant, that is, the fervour of Devotion, which is past, and the sweetness of Divine Familiarity, whereof you have once Tasted, do not imagine thou wilt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find it, unless thou seek as the Virgin sought, that is, with Sorrow and Diligence. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> first repeated many Sorrowful Verses, and gave many Groans, in that Famous Penitential Psalm, and then at the latter end he said, <hi>Render unto me the Joy of thy Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note>
                  <hi>and confirm me with the Principal Spirit.</hi> It was wisely said of a Religious Doctor, <hi>What costs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:154273:123"/> nothing, is worth nothing; and consequently that which is worth much, must cost much.</hi> The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Woman in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> does not bring forth without Excessive Pains; to give thee to understand, that thou shalt not reap the Glorious Fruit of Perfection, but through the Powerful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Affliction: Wherefore St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> says, That, generally-speaking, no extraordinary Grace is Communicated to our Souls, but through Affliction and Prayer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Infant goes away immediately with his Parents, and the Lord of the Creation, with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Submission, Obeys Two Creatures. Humble thy self therefore, thou Dast and Ashes, and Learn from this Example to Obey, not only thy Superiors and Equals, but even thy Inferiors, for the sake of this Lord. But what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that on the one Hand he Obeys them so Humbly, and on the other, he Answers them with such Freedom: <hi>To what end did you seek me?</hi> (says he) <hi>knew ye not, that in these things that belong to my Father, it was convenient for me to be busied?</hi> This is to shew thee, that Christian Philosophy can Unite many Vertues, which seem Opposite, such as Magnanimity and Humility, Gravity and Sweetness, Submission and Freedom, Fervor and Discretion, Justice and Mercy, and the like. Therefore when it is requisite, or for the Honour of God, a true Christian must forgo all Worldly Respects, and trample upon all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Apostle did, who, as occasion offer'd, was sometimes as little as the least of Creatures, and other times equal to the greatest; sometimes he lay'd himself under the Feet of Men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles rais'd himself above all the World.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FRom Twelve to Thirty Years of Age, we find no account in the Gospel of the Life of our Saviour; because he Dedicated all this time, to give us a Lesson very convenient for us, which is Silence; and this he taught us by being silent Thirty Years, tho' when a Child he was full of Wisdom, and spending only Three Years in Preaching, that you may see how much time he Dedicated to a Retir'd Life, and how little to the Ministry of Preaching. <hi>We</hi> (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) <hi>are full of Mouths, and would speak with them all. If we think we know any thing, we cannot be silent; neither do we look upon our selves as Wise Men, unless others know how far our Wisdom reaches.</hi> So that we would have all our Endowments (tho' never so small) be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known to all Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These Thirty Years being Expir'd, our Lord came from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jury,</hi> to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> to the Baptism of St. <hi>John;</hi> where you may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how Poor, Lonesome, and Unattended, our Saviour made this Journey, for as yet he had no Disciples; but above all Observe, how he comes with Publicans, Sinners, and Pharisees, as if he were one of them, waiting his turn to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd with them. Who is there whom this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration will not humble, even with the Dust? Who will presume to Justifie, Extol, or Prefer himself before others? O thou Beauty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Fountain of Purity and Life, what need hast thou of the Laver of Filth? What need hast thou
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:154273:124"/> of the Cleansing of Sinners, since thou wert Conceiv'd without Sin? It was not fit such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humility should pass without a testimony of singular Glory; for it is the Property of our God, to humble the Proud, and to glorifie the Humble. So it appear'd at this time▪ for there the Heavens Open'd, and the Holy Ghost Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the shape of a Dove, and the mighty Voice of the Father resounded, saying, <hi>This is my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, in whom I have pleased my self, hear him.</hi> And it generally happen'd in most Passages of the Life of our Lord, that wheresoever he Humbled himself most, there he was most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Glorify'd. He is Born in a Stable, and there Prais'd with Singing from Heaven. He is Circumcis'd as a Sinner, and there he is call'd <hi>Jesus,</hi> which signifies Saviour of Sinners. He Dies on a Cross betwixt Thieves, and there the Heavens are Darken'd, the Earth Trembles, the Rocks are Cleft, the Dead Arise, and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Mov'd. Even so in this Mystery, on the one hand he is Baptiz'd as a Sinner, among Sinners, and on the other he is declar'd Son of God. By this, all that are his Members may perceive, that they can never humble themselves for the Love of God, but that they shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd and honour'd by God himself.</p>

The first thing we are to learn from this, is, that God does not Cherish his Servants to render them Secure in themselves, but to dispose and strengthen them for greater Sufferings.

Here also it is to be Consider'd, that before our Saviour began to Preach the Gospel, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd himself with a Fast of Forty Days, and with the Solitude and Exercises of the Desart; that hereby thou may'st understand, how weighty an Affair the Salvation of Souls is, since that Lord, who was infinitely Perfect, prepar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so carefully for this Work, tho' he stood not in need of such preparation. From hence also those to whom this Employment belongs may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how they ought to govern themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take this Business in hand. For none ought to appear in the Publick Exercise of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unless he have first spent some time in the Retirement of Contemplation, since (as St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> says) <hi>No Man goes safely abroad, unless he be first well Exercis'd within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:154273:125"/>3. To this purpose it is convenient to know, that Holy Men assign Three sorts of Virtuous Lives; the one meerly Active, which is chiefly employ'd in Works of Mercy; another altogether Contemplative, which is more Perfect than the other, and is taken up with the Exercise of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Contemplation, unless Obedience, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Charity, require the contrary. There is another yet more Perfect than this, which is Compos'd of both the former, having some of the one, and some of the other, such as was the Life of the Apostles, and such as ought to be the Life of all perfect Preachers. Now the Rule to be Observ'd towards this sort of Life (according to St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi>) is, that none ought to pass forward to the second sort, till he has gone thro' the first, nor much less to the third, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conversant in the second. For as St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> says, <hi>Good Preachers must gather in Prayer, what they scatter in Preaching.</hi> So that (next to the Sciences requir'd for this Work) Solitude is the best Mistress of true Preachers, because there God Inspires Words that flow from the Heart, and Reveals the Secrets of his Wisdom to those who are truly Humble.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us then love Solitude, which our Lord Sanctify'd with his Example; for it follows of Course, that he who converses not with Men, should converse with God. O Unhappy Age of ours! Where are now the former Happy Times? Where the Desarts of <hi>Egypt, Thebaida, Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> full of Monasteries and Hermits? Where is the Desart of which the Prophets said, <hi>The Lord will cause the Desart to be full of Delight, and the Wilderness to be like a Garden of God?</hi> Where are those Flowers that continue
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:154273:125"/> always Fresh, tho' planted in a Desart, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water'd Soil? Now Men have abandon'd the Desarts, and deliver'd themselves up to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, full of Cares. Wherefore, if you are not dispos'd to go into the Desart, because the Way is worn out, at least form a Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart within your self, recollecting your Senses, and retiring into your Self; for thus will you come to the Understanding of God. <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Glory of God in the Desart, and in this Spiritual Desart God communicates himself to his Friends. But being entred into this Desart, you must with <hi>Moses</hi> ascend into the Mountain; that is, you must forsake the Mean Things of the World, and lift up your Heart to those of Heaven. To this purpose, you must make use of two Wings; one of Prayer, and the other of Fasting, which is a Help to Prayer; for the Stomach charg'd with Food is not dispos'd to ascend. Now if living in this Desart you still want these Wings, it is easie to guess what Share you will have in that Sentence of the Philosopher, which says, <hi>Man who lives in Solitude, is either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Brutish.</hi> That most Holy Flesh, which knew not what it was to Rebel against the Spirit, Fasted; to the end that your Perverse Flesh might Fast, which, like the Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> casts out Flames to Fire it. Observe, that among Exterior Works, our Lord began by Fasting; because the first Strife of a Christian is against the Vice of Gluttony, which whosoever does not overcome, it will be in vain to labour against the rest. Yet he did not only Fast, but also Pray'd, and Combated with our Adversary, and all for our Advantage. His Solitude was to give us an Example, his Prayer was for our Good, his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:154273:126"/> Fasting was to satisfie our Debts, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats with Satan was to overcome and weaken our Adversary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Do thou then, Dear Brother, accompany our Lord in all these Exercises and Sufferings under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for thy sake; since it is thy Business he is Managing, and making Satisfaction for thy Crimes. Imitate, as much as in thee lies, our Lord; Pray with him, Fast with him, Fight with him, Live sometimes in the Desart with him, Join thy Exercises and Sufferings to his, that thus they may become acceptable to God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Preaching, Doctrine, and Wonderful Works of Christ.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AFter his Baptism, and Forty Days Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Redeemer of the World began to Converse with Men, to apply himself to Preaching, and to make himself Known by the Wonders he wrought. Here are offered to us Four Principal Points to consider, which are, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundness of his Doctrine, the Example of his Virtues, the Sufferings and Manner of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and the Good he did the World by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now as to the First Point, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, That the Doctrine of Christ (which the Gospel particularly Treats of) is so Profound and Perfect, that nothing so Excellent can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. Now for the better understanding hereof, it is necessary we should know, That whereas this great and wonderful Fabrick of the World is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:154273:126"/> divided into Two Ranks of Creatures; one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as are the Angels; and another Corporeal, as are the Heavens, and all things under them; Man is in the midst of both, and therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of both their Natures: For he has a Body, as all Corporeal Things have; and a Spirit, as the Angels, so that he is of both Natures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may apply himself to which Side he pleases, either imitating the Purity and Perfection of Angels, since to that purpose he has a Spirit as well as they: Or the Brutality and Life of Beasts, because he also has a Body; Senses, and Appetites as well as they; but to attain to the First of these Two Manners of Life, he stands in need of Heavenly Assistance. So that as a Man who has study'd Physick and Chirurgery, may practise either of these Sciences, as he pleases, and be either Physician or Chirurgeon, since he has learnt both: So also Man, having Spirit and Flesh, may by inclining to the Flesh, become altogether Carnal and Brutal; or by inclining to Works of the Spirit, become wholly Spiritual, as generally all the Saints were.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now the Heathen Philosophers, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> being sensible of this Truth, they declared that the Perfection of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in Dying, as much as might be, to the Brutal Part that is in him; renouncing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising all his Pleasures, Appetites, and all World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Material Goods, wherein this Part takes Delight; taking no more of them than is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary for the Supporting of Life: And labouring to Live altogether to the other Spiritual and Divine Part, which is in him, containing the Will and Understanding; employing these two most Noble Faculties as the Angels do; that is,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:154273:127"/> in the Knowledge, Love, and Fruition of the Supream Good; thus Uniting and Transforming himself into him by Love, which is the highest Pitch of Perfection a Creature can arrive at. Therefore (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> relates) a <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosopher said, That the Perfection and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men consisted in most pure and absolute Separation from all Matter, and from all Sensual and Earthly Things; and on the other hand, in an Union and Conjunction with the Supreme Father, through Knowledge, Love, and Actual Contemplation; so the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophers call God. Thus, as <hi>Plato</hi> himself says in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue called <hi>Phaedo, Man is united and becomes the same thing Spiritually, not only with the Supreme Intellects,</hi> (which we call Angels) <hi>but also with that Supream Uncreated Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> (which is Christ our Lord) tho' this be not from our Nature or Being; but by partaking of his Sanctity, Felicity, and Purity; as we see Iron cast into the Fire, partakes of the Properties and Qualities of the Fire, without ceasing to be Iron.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if it be objected, How is it possible that a Man in this Life should arrive to such Purity, as to become like to God and his Angels, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself as they do? For the Angels have no Bodies to attend or provide for; and therefore may freely mount high, and Employ themselves in Spiritual Things, as being Creatures wholly Spiritual; which Men cannot do, because of the Burden of their Bodies to which they are bound? This is thus briefly Answered; For this Reason the Saints always labour'd (tho' to the Detriment of the Body) to allow it as little as possible, and as much as with difficulty sufficed to support
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:154273:127"/> Life, and barely feed Nature: To the end, that since they could not altogether forbear Tending the Body, at least, that Attendance might be next to none; and consequently they might not forfeit the Name of Spiritual Men, of Angels on Earth, or of Heavenly Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This (as has been said) is the greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection a Creature can arrive to in this Life, this is it that the Son of God particularly Taught us, and this is it which generally all the Saints fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; but more particularly those who left the World, and all that was in it, and went away to the Desarts; where supplying the Wants of the Body with Roots, and such like things, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their Spirits in Contemplation and Love of the Heavenly Things, after the manner of the Angels. This is the Perfection of the Life of the Gospel, which was most perfectly Represented to us, not only by the Apostles, but also by other Apostolical and Evangelical Men; such as St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who so perfectly quitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all Worldly Things, living in extream Nakedness and Poverty, and spending his Life in the Love and Contemplation of the Eternal; to which he devoted not only the Days, but the greatest part of the Nights too. Now whosoever desires to know the Scope and Bent of all Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Philosophy, let him understand it is no other, than what has been here comprehended in a few words; which (as has been said) is the greatest Perfection that can be imagin'd. For as there is nothing in the World better than God, so no Doctrine can be better than that, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising all things, teaches us to be united to, and become one Spirit with him, in such manner as has been declar'd.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:154273:128"/>6. Now for the carrying on this great Change, there is need of the Assistance of all Virtues; some to aid us to Quit the World, and others to Unite us to God; some to Mortifie our Affection to Earthly Things, and others to Inflame us in the Love of the Eternal; some to cut off all Obstacles in Ascending, and others to Facilitate the Ascent; of all these the Gospel speaks. And because among them there are several Degrees, some being more useful than others; therefore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel chiefly Treats of the Sublimest, and those which are most conducing to this End, such as are chiefly those Three Supreme Virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity; and next to them, Humility, Chastity, Meekness, Patience, Obedience, Mercy, Almsdeeds, Prayer, Poverty of Spirit, Contempt of the World, Mortification of Appetites, Love of the Cross, and a Denial of one's Self and one's Will; with other like Virtues, which are to be sought after above all others, by him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to become an Evangelical Man, and a true Disciple and Follower of Christ.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The better to Attain this End, Man must fix his Eyes upon the Life of our Saviour, where he will find all these Virtues, better expressed by his Actions, than by his Words: For he well knew, how much more short the Way to Virtue is through Example, than through Preaching. And tho' in his Life there be signal Examples of all Virtues, yet above all there appears the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundness of his Humility, the Greatness of his Charity, the Easiness of his Meekness, the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Conversation, the Calmness of his Words, and the Patience and Moderation of all his Actions.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:154273:128"/>8. There is also much to be consider'd in the Sufferings and Continuance of his Travels, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in what manner our Lord Journeyed about for the gaining of Souls, from Province to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, from City to City, from Town to Town, sometimes in <hi>Jury,</hi> sometimes in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>Samaria.</hi> Observe then how Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably this good Shepherd Travell'd over Hills and Dales, seeking the lost Sheep, to bring it back to the Flock upon his Shoulders; and how many Troubles, how much Poverty, Cold, Heat, Weariness, how many Persecutions, Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Calumnies of the Pharisees he endur'd upon this Account, Preaching by Day, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Night; and always handling the Affairs of our Salvation, as a true Father, Shepherd, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Redeemer: See how meekly he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with Sinners, Entring into their Houses, and Eating with them, to the end he might gain them with his Conversation, attract them with his Benefits, edifie them with his Example, and instruct them with his Doctrine. <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, <hi>Zaqueus</hi> Prince of the Publicans, St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who was receiv'd at his Feet, and the Woman taken in Adultery, were all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of this Mercy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither are the other Benefits he bestow'd on the World in his Travels to be less consider'd, as his Curing the Sick, giving Sight to the Blind, Cleansing the Leprous, Restoring the Paraliticks, Casting out Devils, Raising the Dead, and, what is beyond all, delivering Sinners from the Snares of the Devil. Thus our Lord Convers'd among Men, and thus he Travers'd all that Countrey, bestowing Benefits on all Men. And so indeed it was convenient he should Converse with Men,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:154273:129"/> who for them became Man; and such ought to be the Life, in this World, of him that descended from Heaven upon Earth to Visit the World. Such ought to be his Doctrine, his Life, his Example, his Works, and his Benefits, whereby might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd the greatness of his Power, and the excess of his Goodness. For since God was to Incarnate and Converse among Men, such ought to be the Course of his Life, and such the Event and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THO' all the Works and Mercies of our Lord deserve a special Consideration, yet none more than his Meekness and Mercy towards these Four Sinful Women; to wit, the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Woman taken in Adultery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the better clearing of this Point, it is to be understood, that (as may be gather'd from <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>) the End for which God perform'd all his Works, as well those of Nature, as those of Grace, was the Manifestation of his Glory; that is, to declare his great and admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Perfections. Which tho' they be Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and Infinite, (even as he himself is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite) yet they are more especially reduced to Two Heads; for some appertain to his Mercy, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:154273:129"/> some to his Justice; so that some tend to cause him to be Belov'd, and others to be Fear'd. And tho' these two sorts of Perfections appear in all his Works (wherein a mixture of Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is always to be found) yet still there are some in which his Justice is most Visible, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wherein his Mercy is most Apparent. For his Justice singularly Exerted it self in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Proud Angel, in the Disobedience of Man, in the Destruction of the World by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Deluge; and finally, in all that are Damn'd, whom therefore the Apostle calls Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Wrath. But on the other side, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Mercy and Goodness is visible in all the Elect, and in all the Benefits God bestows on them, to cause their Election; and for this reason they are called Vessels of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to the end these Two Perfections might be the more plainly Demonstrated, our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed two Times, and two sorts of Works; that is, two Comings to the World; one to declare the greatness of his Justice, which will be the coming to Judgment; and the other to express his Goodness and Mercy, which was his coming in Flesh to work our Redemption. For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>David</hi> pray'd, when he said,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.3.</note>
                  <hi>Shew us, O Lord, thy Mercy, and give us thy Salvation.</hi> For he well knew how much the greatness of this Mercy would be made known to the World by this coming, and by this Work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this purpose therefore came the Son of God into this VVorld, to let Men know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Father's, and his own Mercy, which is all the same. For which reason he said to one of his Disciples; <hi>Philip, he that seeth me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joan. 14.</note>
                  <hi>seeth my Father also,</hi> And a little higher; <hi>If ye knew me,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:154273:130"/> ye would also know my Father, and now ye shall know him, and ye have already seen him.</hi> As if he had said, you shall then know him more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, when the Holy Ghost shall come and give you more Light and Understanding. And you have already seen him, having seen me, how I Convers'd among Men with so much Meekness, Goodness and Mercy, for such is my Father, as I am; and if he were to come to the VVorld, and to Converse among Men, he would Converse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this same manner, and Speak the same Words, for all that I Speak and Act, he Speaks and Acts in me.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whoever therefore desires to know the Goodness and Mercy of the Eternal Father, let him look upon his only Begotten Son, who is the most Perfect Image, not only of his Substance and Beauty, but also of his Goodness and Mercy, which he came to make known to Men here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, as he discovers it to the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that here and there he may always be to Men and Angels the true Resemblance of the Glory of God; for to the Son it belongs to be the Resemblance and Picture of his Father. Let Man therefore fix his Eyes upon our Lord; let him look upon his Incarnation, his Nativity, his Life, his Death, and all the Actions he did in this World, for they are all full of Goodness and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to which this first coming was Dedicated; that hence he may gather how great cause he has to Love him with all his Heart, and to Hope in him in all his Afflictions; for so great Goodness requires an excess of Love (since the Object of Love is Goodness) and so great Compassion and Mercy claims an entire Confidence, for otherwise he vainly Praises the Mercy of God, who at a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:154273:130"/> time of Need Hopes not in it; and he knows not how to Hope, who Desponds in Tribulation, and Confides not in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you would more particularly Meditate on this Mercy (laying aside other Actions of his most Holy Life) look upon what pass'd betwixt him and those Four Sinful Women above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and in each of them, as in a Mirror, you will discover the Compassion and Mercy of this most Generous and Benign Lord, that the more you dive into this knowledge, the more your Love and Confidence in him may increase.</p>

                  <hi>Of the</hi> Samaritan <hi>Woman.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IN regard to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, there first Occurrs that most ardent Thirsting of our Saviour after our Salvation, which is beyond all that we can express. It is written of St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> that when she saw any Preacher pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Street, she would go out of her House, and devoutly kiss the Ground he trod upon. And being ask'd why she did so, she answered, <hi>That our Saviour had made known to her the Beauty of such Souls as were in a State of Grace, and that therefore she accounted those Men who labour'd in that Affair so Blessed, that she could not forbear laying her Mouth to the Place where their Feet had been, and kissing the Ground they stood upon.</hi> Now if this Holy Saint, through that little Light and Grace she had receiv'd, became so Zealous, what can we think of the Zeal of him who is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:154273:131"/> the Fountain of Grace? Of him who was so great a Lover of our Souls? Of him who came to be the Father of future Generations? And of him whose Bowels were full of Zeal for God's Glory? It was this great Love that made our Lord descend from Heaven upon Earth. This it was that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested and kept him Waking, and made him Sweat, Labour, and always be in Search of Souls whom he might Save.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Travelling on this Account, he once came to the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> about Noon, much Tired, Scorch'd with the Sun, and Sweating. So that here for our sake our Rest was Tired, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment Sweated, the Bread of Angels was Hungry, and the Fountain of Life Thirsted. The Fountain of Living Waters sat down by the Well, like to any other Poor, Tired and Needy Person. Neither ought you to believe he sate down to drink, for no mention is made that he drank, but to wait an opportunity to gain a Soul that was to come thither, and mercifully to Secure it at that Drinking-place. So that, tho' he was weary with Travelling, he was not so to do Good; and therefore a Sinful Woman coming to the VVell, he ask'd of her VVater, as one Tired, and offer'd her Grace, as Desiring and Thirsting after her Salvation. <hi>Woman,</hi> (says he) <hi>give me to drink.</hi> Observe here the Incomparable Humility, Affability and Meekness of our Lord, who so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily enter'd into Discourse with this Soul, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and Enlightning her, answering her Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, offering her his Grace, and giving her Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to beg it of him, as she did, tho' she knew not what she ask'd. Now had this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to some discreet Person of a good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there were less to admire in it; but all this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:154273:131"/> Dialogue was with a VVoman that carry'd VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> an Idolater, the VVife of Five Husbands, and then actually in Sin, which are the vilest Circumstances that can be imagin'd, and yet our Lord Converses with her so Meekly, and not only Converses, but so clearly, and in such plain terms tells her who he is, that scarce any thing so positive can be found throughout the Gospel. And not so satisfy'd, he adds still a greater Mercy, for of a <hi>Samaritan</hi> he made her the Evangelist, and Apostle of <hi>Samaria;</hi> and this he did when this VVoman came to the VVell for a Pitcher of VVater, without any further thought or design, when she imagin'd, or sought nothing less than what she found. O VVonderful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God! O hidden Secrets of his VVisdom and Goodness! VVho is there so blind, that he does not here see the Goodness and Mercy of our Lord? VVhat is there in all this VVork, but pure Grace, pure Goodness, and pure Mercy? For where on the part of Man there is no sort of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but rather Demerit and Obstructions, what can there be on the part of God, but Goodness and Mercy?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that nothing might be wanting to the fulness of this Mercy, our Lord did it so willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was so pleas'd that he had done it, that when his Disciples came, and ask'd him to Eat, he answer'd, <hi>I have already Food which you know not.</hi> And they asking, <hi>What Food it was;</hi> He answer'd, <hi>My Food is to do the Will of my Father, who sent me, and to do the Work for which he sent me, which is the Salvation of Men.</hi> Now who is there but by these VVords and Actions, must disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Infinite Goodness and Mercy of our Lord, who makes our Salvation his Food and Drink.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Woman of</hi> Canaan.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOR is this Mercy less visible in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage with the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho' to outward appearance he dealt otherwise with her; yet all tended to the working of the same Mercy and Salvation, though after several man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Saviour therefore going out of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Jewry,</hi> and this Woman going out of her Countrey, she obtain'd the Salvation she sought after; to the end thou may'st understand, that when Man acts his part, and God his, true Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is obtain'd. Neither does it suffice that Man act, unless God assist; nor is it enough that God assist, unless Man act, for both parts are necessary, as the Próphet express'd, saying, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our Lord build the House,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 126.1.</note>
                  <hi>they have labour'd in vain that build it.</hi> But this Divine Grace and Assistance, is not always Communicated after the same manner, but according as the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Mercy sees fit. For on some it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd with such ease, that it seems to flow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them without being sought after; and yet others find it not without much trouble. So that there are some whom God seeks, and some who seek God; some who are like him that finds the hidden Treasure in the Field, without looking for it; and others, like the careful Merchant, who sought for the precious Pearl, and found it. We have an Example of both sorts in these Two Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Women; one of which, with such ease, found that which she did not look for; and the other,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:154273:132"/> who with much intreaty and perseverance obtain'd what she desir'd. And tho' the Divine Mercy be more resplendent in the former, and the Justice in the latter; yet this Mercy is not Inferiour to that, for it is the Gift of God, and his Work of Mercy to seek God, with Faith, Humility and Perseverance. If therefore he that thus seeks God, would be instructed how to seek him, let him fix his Eyes upon this Sinful VVoman, and seek as she sought, and he will find as she found.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how did she seek? VVith great Faith, great Humility, and great Perseverance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she Cry'd aloud, Follow'd, Importun'd, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever'd, Suffer'd, Confided, Humbled, and Prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her self at the Feet of Christ; and thus she found what she desir'd. Do thou then seek God after this manner, and be assur'd, that tho' thou hast been an Idolater, and <hi>Canaanite,</hi> thou shalt at last find him.<note place="margin">Jer. 29.</note>
                  <hi>Ye shall find me</hi> (says our Lord) <hi>if ye seek me with all your Heart;</hi> and to seek him with all our Heart, is to seek him with Faith, Humility, Patience, Perseverance, and continual Prayer, as this VVoman sought him.</p>

                  <hi>1. NEither is this Mercy and Goodness of our Saviour less Conspicuous in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of St.</hi> Mary Magdalen. <hi>For how could so dissolute a VVoman have been Converted with such Fervour and Contrition, unless our Lord had Disposed, Enlightned and Stirr'd her up with his
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:154273:133"/> great Mercy? VVherefore St.</hi> Gregory <hi>says,</hi> What is it we admire, Brethren? That <hi>Mary</hi> comes, or that our Lord receives her? That he receives her, I say, or that he draws her? Or rather that he draws and receives her? For he who by his Mercy inwardly drew her, the same by his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness outwardly receiv'd her.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Our Lord being at Dinner in the House of a Pharisee <hi>(says the Evangelist)</hi> this Sinful Woman came, and approaching to him behind his Back <hi>(for she durst not appear before his Face)</hi> she began to water his Feet with Tears, to dry them with her Hair, and to kiss and anoint them with Ointment. <hi>Now what sort of Penance and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction could be found more proper, or suitable to her course of Life? VVhom will not this so new sort of Penance move to Tears and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? At least it mov'd the Blessed St.</hi> Gregory, <hi>who speaking of this Sinful VVoman, says thus;</hi> When I consider this Penitence of <hi>Mary,</hi> I am more dispos'd to Weep, than to Discourse upon it. For what Heart is there so hard, whom the Tears of this Sinful Woman do not move to Repentance? For she reflecting upon what she had done till then, would not set any Bounds to what she was to do for the future. Therefore she Enter'd into the place where the Guests were; she came without being call'd, and amidst the Dishes Offer'd Tears; by which you may judge what a Flame of Love was kindled in her, since she was not asham'd to Weep amidst the Rejoicing of the Guests. For she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foulness of her Soul, ran to wash her self at the Fountain of Mercy, without being asham'd that so many look'd on; because being so confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within, she saw nothing to blush at without. Falling prostrate at the Feet of our Lord, she began
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:154273:133"/> to bathe them with Tears, to dry them with her Hair, and to kiss, and anoint them with Ointment. Hitherto this Woman had made use of Precious Ointments to pamper her Fesh, but now she wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily applies that to the Service of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she put to Filthy Uses. With her Eyes she had seen and coveted Earthly things; but now she chastiz'd them, shedding abundance of Tears. With her Mouth she had spoken vain Words, but now she sanctify'd her Mouth, kissing the humble Feet of our Lord. Her Hair she had made use of to set out her Face, but with it now she dry'd up the Tears she had shed upon the Feet of Christ. So that of what had caus'd her Delight, she made an entire Offering and Sacrifice; and thus she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a Vertuous Use all that before had been subservient to Vice, that all those things which had offended God, during her continuance in Sin, might serve him now she was come to Penance. Who is there that does not perceive the Greatness of this Repentance, and the Excess of the Divine Mercy and Grace, which was her chief Accuser and Mover? For what Head what Heart, what Eyes, could have shed such a Flood of Tears, as might suffice to wash the Feet of Christ? And what Wit could have found out such a new Invention to dry them, as the making use of her Hair; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our Lord had inspir'd her Soul with such Light and Love? And whence came so great a Gift to so unworthy a Creature, but from his Excess of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy? Yet all this great Penitence could not save this Woman from being Condemn'd by the proud Pharisee; yet Christ Absolves her, whilst she stands silent; whence you may Collect the difference betwixt the Judgments of God, and of Men, and how powerful a Means Silence is to make God our Defender.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Woman taken in Adultery.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the Case of the VVoman taken in Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have also occasion to consider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Sweetness and Mercy of our Lord, which furnish'd his Enemies with this Oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of endeavouring to cast some Reproach upon him; for such was his Life, his Doctrine, his VVorks, and his VVords, that they thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any Sentence of Condemnation could be utter'd by that Mouth, which was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Compassion. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Adversaries could find no way to Accuse him, but by endeavouring to hinder his Prayer, to which he was so much addicted; nor could our Saviour's Enemies find any other Method than by bringing into danger his Mercy and Meekness, upon which he so much valued himself, and which he discover'd to us many different Ways in the Gospel. For what greater Mercy could there be than so heartily to recommend this Virtue, as he did by these words, <hi>What ye have done to any of these Little Ones,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note>
                  <hi>my Brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 19.</note>
                  <hi>to me have ye done it?</hi> And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats almost the same Words by the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> saying, <hi>This is my Rest, and my Refreshment, that ye Refresh and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort those that are Weary.</hi> VVe also read in the Gospel, that our Lord Travelling through the Country of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> refusing to receive him; the Apostles, incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those People, said to him: <hi>Wilt thou that we Command Fire to fall from Heaven and destroy them?</hi> To whom our Lord, with his usual Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:154273:134"/> and Mercy, answered, <hi>Know ye not of what Spirit ye are? The Son of Man came not to destroy Souls, but to save them.</hi> This Mercy and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> foresaw, when speaking of the Qualities of the Messias, he said:</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He shall not cry, nor accept Person,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 42.2.</note>
                  <hi>neither shall his Voice be heard abroad. The bruis'd Reed he shall not break, and smoaking Flax he shall not quench.</hi> VVhich plainly appears in his Judgment concerning this Woman, of whom our Lord ask'd, <hi>Woman, where are they that accus'd thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 8.10.</note>
                  <hi>Did none condemn thee?</hi> The Woman answered, <hi>None, Lord: Then neither will I condemn thee,</hi> (said our Lord) <hi>Go in Peace, and Sin no more.</hi> This is it the Prophet meant, when he said, <hi>That he would not break the bruis'd Reed, nor quench the Flax that smoak'd.</hi> Thus expressing the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Saviour's Mercy at his First Coming. Such then must be thy Bowels, thy Words, and thy Actions, if thou wilt be the true Image of our Lord. And therefore the Apostle thinks not enough to bid us be Merciful, but says, <hi>We must,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.12.</note>
                  <hi>like Chosen, Holy, and Beloved Children of God, put on Bowels of Mercy.</hi> Now consider what a World it would be, if all Men were thus Cloath'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All this has been said, to the end that by these remarkable Works we may know somewhat of the Infinite Goodness and Mercy of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which so plainly appears in these Actions; since (as was said above) we cannot in this Life know God, but by his Works, as Causes are known by their Effects. But here it must be observ'd, that this Knowledge is not to be made use of (as is done by Wicked Men) to encourage us to persist in a Vicious Course of Life; presuming
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:154273:135"/> upon God's Mercy, and making his Goodness the Instrument of our Wickedness, which is a most Grievous Offence. This Knowledge is to serve to Inflame us in the Love of so great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to move us to Hope in such Mercy; for such Goodness and Mercy require a suitable Return of Love and Hope. And yet we see many fail in this Point, even among those who have obtain'd other Virtues; for they, when any Affliction comes upon them, are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd and discourag'd, as if they had never Heard or Read of this Goodness and Mercy; without reflecting, that it is to this purpose, that most of the Psalms, and almost all the Holy Scripture, do particularly Extol Divine Mercy, and bid us to Hope in it; that having so sure a Pledge as the Word of God, we may confide in the Time of Tribulation, and not lose our Hope in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here also the Christian Reader must be advertis'd, that we must never suffer our selves to be so far Transported in the Consideration of God's Mercy, as not to remember his Justice; nor to be so wholly taken up with the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Justice, as not to think on his Mercy; that so our Hope may not be void of Fear, nor our Fear wholly want Hope. For, <hi>These</hi> (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) <hi>are, as it were, God's two Feet, which we ought to Kiss and Adore together, and not the one without the other; lest Hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear, may rise to be Presumption; or Fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hope, may fall into Despair.</hi> Wherefore the Prophet says, <hi>That he will Sing to the Lord, Mercy and Justice jointly;</hi> because he well knew how dangerous it was to Sing the one without the other; that is, Mercy without Judgment, or Judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:154273:135"/> Mercy; that so neither Hope may be Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, nor Fear Desponding.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Transfiguration of our Lord.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AMong the Principal Passages of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life, one very Remarkable is that of his Glorious <hi>Transfiguration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> when taking with him three of his best Belov'd Disciples, and with whom he was most familiar, he ascended a Mountain, and being there in Prayer, (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith) <hi>He was Transfigured before them, in such manner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 9.</note>
                  <hi>that his Countenance shin'd like the Sun, and his Garments became white as Snow.</hi> Consider here in the first place, the Wonderful Art our Lord made use of, to draw us to him. He perceiv'd, that Men were sooner mov'd by the Possession of Present Bliss, than by Promises of Future Happiness, according to that Sentence of the Wise Man, saying, <hi>It is better to see that which thou may'st covet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 6.9.</note>
                  <hi>than to desire that which thou canst not know.</hi> Therefore after he had often Preach'd to them, that their Reward should be great in Heaven, and that they should be Seated upon Twelve Seats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now he gives them a small Taste of this Reward; to the end, that the Wrestler being shown the Reward of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, might gather new Strength for the Encounter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet he shew'd not here the best Part of this Promise, to wit, the Essential Glory of the Blessed; because it is above all Human Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, but only an Accidental Part; that is, the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:154273:136"/> Brightness and Beauty of the Glorifi'd Bodies; and for so doing there was particular Reason. For it is this Flesh which Retards us on our Journey, it is that which Obstructs our Imitating Christ, and it is that which Hinders us from Carrying his Cross. And therefore it was convenient for the Enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Quickning of it, to show it the Greatness of this Glory, that so it might gather Strength to Run this Race. Therefore if thou Faint here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thou art commanded to Crucifie and Mortifie the Flesh, take Courage at what the Apostle says, which is, <hi>We hope in Jesus Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who will Reform the Body of our Humanity, making it like unto the Body of his Glorious Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider also, how our Lord Celebrated this Glorious Feast upon a solitary and remote Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which he might as well have done in a Valley, or any Publick Place; to give thee to understand, that Men do not obtain this Benefit of Transfiguration amidst the Publick Business of this World, but in the Solitude of Retirement; nor in the dismal Vale of Beastly Appetites, but on the Mount of Mortification; that is, by the Victory over Sensual Appetites. On this Solitary Mount is to be seen Christ Transfigured; on it is seen the Beauty of God; on it are receiv'd the Pledges of the Holy Ghost; on it is given a Taste of that River, which rejoices the City of God; and lastly, on it is offer'd a 'Say of that Precious Wine which Inebriates the Inhabitants of Heaven. Could'st thou but once reach the Top of this Mount, how sincerely would'st thou say with the Apostle St. <hi>Peter, Lord, it is good for us to be here?</hi> As if he would have said; Lord, let us quit all things for this Mountain, let us
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:154273:136"/> give all the Goods and Pleasures of the World, for the Pleasure of this Desart. But the Evangelist says, <hi>S.</hi> Peter <hi>knew not what he said;</hi> to give thee to understand, the Greatness of this Pleasure, and the Strength of this Heavenly Wine, which so Charms Human Hearts, that they are wholly Abstracted from themselves: For St. <hi>Peter</hi> was so Rapt, that he knew not what he said, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred any thing of this World, so great was the Delight and Pleasure he then enjoy'd. Neither did he desire ever to be separated from that Bliss; and therefore said, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles; one for Thee, and one for</hi> Moses, <hi>and one for</hi> Elias. Now if St. <hi>Peter</hi> spoke thus, when he had tasted but one Drop of that Heavenly Wine, and was still living in this Banishment, and in a Mortal Body, what would he have said, had he drank a full Draught of that Impetuous Torrent of Delight, which rejoices the City of God? If one of the Crumbs that fell from that Heavenly Table, so satisfi'd and enrich'd him, that he only desir'd the Continuance of that Blessing; what would he have done, had he enjoy'd the Plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Table of those who See and Enjoy God, whose Food is God himself? By this Wonderful Passage thou may'st understand, That the Life of the Just in this Banishment is not all Crosses and Sufferings; for that Merciful Lord and Father, who has Charge of them, knows at his due Times how to Visit, Comfort, and Give them, even in this Life, a Taste of the Delights of the other; that they may not sink under their Burden, nor fail in the Race.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider also, that our Saviour was thus Transfigur'd, being at Prayer; to let thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:154273:137"/> that Pious Souls use often to be Spiritually Transfigur'd at Prayer; receiving there a new Spirit, new Light, new Courage, and new Purity of Life. And in short, a Heart so resolv'd, and so chang'd, that it seems not the same it was before, God having so much alter'd and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Reflect likewise, what it is he Talks of amidst this Glory; that is, of his Sufferings in <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> That hereby thou may'st under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to what end. God bestows these Benefits, and what Thoughts and Resolutions a Servant of God is to entertain at such a time; which ought to be Desires and Intentions, to suffer and lay down his Life for him, who has communicated to him such Sweetness, and who is so worthy of all this, and much more. So that whensoever God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows on Man a Taste of his Sweetness, then ought he to entertain himself with the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pains he will endure for his sake; for such Gifts as these are, require and demand a suitable Return on our Part.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">An Introduction to the Holy Passion of our Saviour; wherein is declar'd, the Method we are to use in Meditating upon it.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAving briefly Treated of the Principal Mysteries of our Saviour's Life, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that with the same brevity we discourse of those of his Holy Passion. The Consideration
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:154273:137"/> of this Subject is of so great Advantage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Christian Souls, that it would take up much time to handle it as it deserves. Therefore leaving this Subject for another place, we will here in few Words declare, what Method is to be us'd in Meditating upon it, that we may reap the greater Benefit. For there are some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who when they apply themselves to this Affair, only have regard to feel a singular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for the Pains our Saviour endur'd. This, tho' it be a Good and Pious Practice, yet it is not the only Fruit that is to be gather'd from this Tree of Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is therefore to be observ'd, That there are Five Things to which we ought to have Regard, when we Meditate on the Passion of our Saviour, besides that here above-mentioned. For in the First Place, we may incline our Heart to Sorrow and Repentance for our Sins; our Saviour's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being an excellent Motive to it; since it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all he Endur'd was for Sins; so that if there had been no Sins in the World, there had also been no need of this Costly Redemption. Thus it is plain, that thy Sins, mine, and those of all the World, were the cruel Executioners, that Bound, Scourg'd, Crown'd with Thorns,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.3.</note> and Nail'd him to the Cross. Whence thou may'st gather, how much Cause thou hast at this time to bewail the Greatness and Malice of thy Sins; since in Effect they were the Cause of those Great Sufferings. Not that they necessitated the Son of God to Suffer, but because they mov'd the Divine Justice to require such ample Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither does our Saviour's Passion only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with Motives to hate Sin,<note place="margin">Joan. 14.</note> but also to love Virtue; presenting before our Eyes the Examples
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:154273:138"/> of it given us by our Lord, which most signally appear in his Holy Passion; to which also we ought to have special Regard, that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to Imitate them; and most particularly those of his Humility, Patience, Obedience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Silence, with all others; for this is the most perfect manner of Meditating on the Holy Passion; to wit, by way of Imitation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Otherwhiles we ought to have regard to the Greatness of the Benefit at this time bestow'd on us by our Lord; considering how much he lov'd us, how much he gave us, and how dear that cost him which he gave us, with all other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances relating to it; that thus we may be mov'd to give him Infinite Thanks for these Mercies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another time, it will be proper by these Means to lift up our Understanding to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; that is, to consider the Greatness of his Goodness, Mercy, Justice, Benignity, and above all, his most ardent Charity, which is no where so visible as in his Holy Passion. For whereas it is a greater Argument of Love, to Suffer Evils for a Friend, than to do him Good Offices, and both were in the Power of God; (so that Man had not as yet so true a Knowledge of his Love) it pleased his Divine Goodness to take upon him a Nature that might be capable of Suffering; to the end that Man might be throughly convinc'd of his Love, and consequently the more mov'd to Love him, by whom he was so passionately Lov'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He may here also consider the Profoundness of the Divine Wisdom, and how fit Means it chose for the Redemption of Mankind; that is, to make Satisfaction for our Sins; to inflame our Charity, to strengthen our Patience, to confirm our Hope,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:154273:138"/> to humble our Pride, to remove our Avarice and Sloth, and to incline our Souls to the Virtue of Humility, to the Contempt of the World, to the Hatred of Sin, to the Love of the Cross, and to other the like Virtues.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So that we have here Six several Methods of Meditating upon the Holy Passion. The First by way of Compassion; the Second of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Third of Imitation; the Fourth of Gratitude; the Fifth of Love; and the Sixth of Admiration at the Divine Wisdom and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In any Passage of the Passion, we shall find Motives to stir up all these several Virtues; and therefore we ought to have Regard to them all at times, according as the Holy Ghost shall lay them before us. True it is, that some of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations more peculiarly belong to some sorts of Persons, than to others: For the First and Second suit well with Beginners; that is, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and Contrition; but the others are more proper to those who have made a further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, because they excite and inflame the Love of God; yet not so, but that they are all common to all sorts of Persons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But it is here to be observ'd, That the Ground and Foundation of all these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, stands upon our Understanding, and being as sensible as possible of the Grievousness of the Pains endur'd by our Saviour: For the greater we conceive those Pains to be, so much the greater Motive of Compassion we have; for there is no doubt, but the greatest Sufferings deserve the greatest Compassion: So also, the greater were the Pains our Lord endur'd for the destroying of Sin, the greater Motive have we to hate that which cost him so dear to destroy. The Excellency
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:154273:139"/> of his Virtues is likewise more visible in the Greatness of his Sufferings; for there is no doubt but that is the greatest Patience, which endures Most; that the greatest Humility, which is most Depress'd; that the greatest Meekness, which is Silent amidst the greatest Wrongs; and that the greatest Obedience, which Submits to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest Burden; and in the same manner we may run through all other Virtues. Neither is this less conducing to excite Love; for if we be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Love Christ for what he Suffer'd for our sake, the greater this Suffering was, the greater is our Obligation. The Greatness also of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is hereby express'd; for the Dearer our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption cost our Saviour, the Greater is the Debt we owe him. This also gives us a true Knowledge of God; that is, a Knowledge of the Immensity of his Charity, his Goodness, his Mercy, and his Justice, the Knowledge of which Things is of great Consequence, to excite in Men's Hearts the Love and Fear of God, and to move them to keep his Commandments: For the greater Knowledge we have of the Grievousness of his Sufferings, the more plainly we perceive the Greatness of the Charity, which endur'd so much; of the Goodness, which extended so far; of the Mercy, which took upon it self such Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and of the Justice, which so severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes Sin, even in its own Person.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus it appears, that the Conceiving of the Greatness of these Pains, is the Foundation and Ground-work of all these Considerations. When we have once grounded our selves upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, we shall find Motives to make all these Sallies here spoken of, as occasion shall offer. And according as our Soul shall find Content in these
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:154273:139"/> Considerations, so it may spend a longer or a shorter time upon any one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem, suitable to the Benefit it shall reap by it. For it is not always necessary to run through them all; but they are all proposed, because all are Due a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>nt in one, may find it in another. For this Reason I thought it would be convenient, before I enter upon the Mysteries of the Holy Passion, to say somewhat in short of the Grievousness of the Pains our Saviour endur'd, and of the Causes of them; whereof much has been said in the Book of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> but here they shall be briefly handled.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="25" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Grievousness of the Pains our Saviour endured.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ST. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in his Third Part, asks, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pains which Christ endur'd in his Holy Passion, were the greatest that ever were endur'd in the World? Which Question he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers himself, saying, <hi>That laying aside the Pains of the other Life, which are those of Hell and Purgatory, these were the greatest that in the World ever were, or will be endur'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Assertion he Proves by many Reasons. First, by the Greatness of Christ's Charity, which was the greatest that could be imagin'd, and caus'd him most earnestly to covet God's Glory, and the Salvation of Man. And because the greater Pains he endur'd for Sin, the more fully
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:154273:140"/> he made Atonement to God, who had been Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the more compleatly he Redeem'd Man, who had Offended; therefore he would have his Pains be Excessive, that so our Redemption might be Perfect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Second Cause was the Simple Nature of his Pains, which had no mixture of Comfort or Ease. For never any Body in this Life suffer'd such absolute Pains, or had not at some time some qualification of Comfort, that might now and then render them Tolerable, and even in some Cases Pleasing, as it hapned to the Martyrs. But in Christ it was not so, for the reason above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, he precluded all ways, by which he might receive the least Ease, or Comfort; and so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd himself up to the violence of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they might Wrack and Torture him as much as was possible, without any Opposition or Mitigation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Third Cause was the Tenderness of his Body, which was not Fram'd by Man, but by Virtue of the Holy Ghost, for which reason it was the most Perfect and best Constitution'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Nature; and consequently was the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest, and most Sensible, and therefore felt Pain more than any other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He also was most highly Afflicted for his Blessed Mother, whose Heart he knew would be pierc'd with a more violent Grief than ever Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr endur'd; for as no Martyr ever so entirely Lov'd his own Life, as she did her Son's, so no Martyr was ever so Concern'd for his own Death, as she was for her Son's.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He was likewise naturally Griev'd with the Thoughts and Imaginations of his own Death. For as it is Natural to love Life, so is it also to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:154273:140"/> dread Death; and this in so much the higher Degree, by how much that Life deserves to be belov'd. Wherefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, That the Wise Man passionately Loves his Life, because, as a Wise Man, he knows such a Life d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>serves to be much Lov'd. Now according to this, how passionately must our Saviour Love that Life, one Hour whereof, he knew, was worth more than all Created Lives? These things afflicted that most Holy Soul, above all that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd. So that the Pains of his Soul seem to have been much greater than those of his Body, and his Invisible Inward Passion much more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than the Visible he Outwardly endur'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Moreover, the very manner of his Death, which was on a Cross, is most Painful, (as shall be declar'd hereafter) to which may be added, that in this Death there Concurr'd so many sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Torments, and Pains, that there was no Part of the Sacred Humanity (excepting the Superiour Portion of the Soul) which did not suffer its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Torture. For he endured in his Soul those Torments we have already mention'd, and in his Body those we are to speak of. He also suffer'd in his Reputation, by the false Accusations, and slanderous Pretences, for which he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. He Suffer'd in his Honour, by so many and sundry sorts of Affronts and Reproaches put upon him. He Suffer'd in his Goods, which were only those poor Cloaths he wore, of which he was Despoil'd, and Nail'd upon the Cross Naked. He Suffer'd in his Friends, for they all fled and forsook, and left him in the Hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He Suffer'd in all the Members and Sences of his Sacred Body, each feeling its particular Pain. His Head was Crown'd with Thorns; his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:154273:141"/> Eyes overflow'd with Tears; his Ears vex'd with Reproaches; his Cheeks Buffeted; his Face de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd with Spittle; his Mouth drench'd with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and Gall; his Beard torn; his Hands pierc'd with Nails; his Side laid open with a Spear; his Back bruis'd with Scourges; his Feet struck through with Nails; and in short, all his Body disjointed, bloody, and stretch'd out on the Cross. The reason was, that as all the Members of his Mystical Body were Gaull'd and Wounded; so likewise all the Members of his Natural and Real Body might be Afflicted and Tortur'd. And also, that since our Malice had been such, that we had Offended God with all our Sences, with all our Members, and with all that was ours, Christ might make such a suitable Satisfaction, that he might endure Pain in every Part, since we with all ours had committed Sins.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And this Pain was much increas'd by the multitude and continuance of Sufferings our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour went through, from the time of his being Apprehended, till he Expir'd upon the Cross. For during this time every one endeavour'd to outdo the other, in Tormenting him after a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner. One Apprehends, another Binds, another Accuses, another Scoffs, another Spits upon, another Buffets, another Scourges, another Crowns, another Strikes with the Cane, another Binds his Eyes, another Cloaths, another Strips, another Blasphemes, and another Loads him with the Cross; and thus every one was employ'd in putting him to some new sort of Torment. They Hurry him up and down, and Drag him from Judgment-Seat to Judgment-Seat, from Tribunal to Tribunal, from High-Priest to High-Priest, as as if he were some Common Thief, or Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:154273:141"/> O King of Glory, how infinitely are we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to thee, for so many, and such sundry sorts of Sufferings, as thou went'st through for our sake? Now these, and other the like reasons, prove, that the Pains our Saviour endur'd, do exceed all the Pains that ever yet were, or ever will be suffer'd in this Life.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now what Benefit shall we reap by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration? Certainly it is great and inestimable: For the Cross of Christ, in short, teaches us all that is to be learnt of Christian Philosophy; and all that is wrought by the Law and Gospel, (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us the true knowledge of Good, and the love of it) all this is in its way Taught and Perform'd by the knowledge of the Cross. For in the first place, by this, better than by all other Worldly Means, we attain to a perfect Understanding of the Heinousness and Malice of Sin, seeing what our Saviour endur'd for it, and what he did to destroy it. By this we may know the Grievousness of the Pains of Hell, seeing our Lord would enter into such a Hell of Pains and Sufferings, to deliver us from them. By this we may perceive the Value of the Goods of Grace and Glory, seeing Justice required such Merit to Retrieve them after they had been Lost. By this may be discover'd the Dignity of Man, and Value of his Soul, seeing how much God valued it, since he gave such a Price for it. By this, better than by any other Means, we obtain the Knowledge of God; not such a knowledge as the Philosophers had, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd them nothing; for they knew little besides his Omnipotency and Wisdom, which appear in the Works of his Creation; but such as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to make Men Religious, and Holy; that is, the knowledge of God's Goodness, Charity, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:154273:142"/> Providence and Justice; for this knowledge causes in us the Love and Fear of God, a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Mercy, and Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; which Virtues are the Foundation of True Religion. Now thus it appears, how much these Vertues exert themselves in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; for to Goodness it appertains to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, and to bestow it self, to love to do good to the Person belov'd; to Mercy, to take upon it self all the Miseries and Calamities of the Miserable; and to Justice, severely to punish the Guilty. This being so, what greater Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness could there be, than for Christ to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himself, and become the same thing with Man? What greater Charity, than to make Man partaker of his Bliss? What greater Mercy, than to take upon him all Man's Debts and Miseries? What greater Mercy, than for God to receive the Stripes due to our Crimes? To Carry our Cross? To Drink our Chalice? To be Tormented for our Pleasures, Dishonour'd for our Pride, Stripp'd on the Cross for our Covetousness; and in short, to be Deliver'd up to the Power of Darkness, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from it? Can there be any greater Mercy than this? Yet his answer is not less Visible; for what greater Justice could there be, than that God should take such a strange sort of Revenge for the Sins of the World, on the Person of his most Dear and Innocent Son? For he is a most Just Judge who spares not his own Son, because he has taken upon him the Crimes of others. Who then is there that will not Dread such Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? And who will not Hope in such Mercy? And who will not Love such Goodness? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no greater Motives of Love, Fear, Obedience, and Hope, could have been given to Man than
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:154273:142"/> were here given; and I know not what can overcome that Heart which is not overcome by this.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Besides, how great Examples and Motives have we here to Excite us to all other Virtues, and particularly to those of Humility, Patience, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Meekness, Poverty of Spirit, and all others? For (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) Examples of Virtue are of so much the greater Force, by how much the Persons are the greater from whom they come. For who can find in his Heart to Ride, when he sees his King go a Foot? Or who can lye in Bed, when he sees him ready to enter into Battel? Then if the Examples of Kings, who are Mortal Men like us, be of such Force, how much more prevalent should the Examples be that are set us by that Supreme Majesty which did so much for us? And more especially, because in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Saviour there is another sort of Force and Dignity, not to be found in any other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For his Examples are of such a sort, that they are at the same time Benefits, Remedies, Medicines, and Incentives to Love, Devotion, and all manner of Virtue.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Let us then give infinite Thanks to our Lord for so great a benefit; that is, for so much as he has given, for so great a Price as it cost him, and above all, for the great Love he bore us; for he Lov'd much more than he Suffer'd, and would have Suffer'd much more had it been necessary for us. On all these Accounts we Owe him Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Gratitude; and since we have nothing of our own, worth giving in return, at least let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that all our Life may be his, since all his was ours. Having now premis'd this small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, we will briefly set down the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:154273:143"/> Mysteries of the Passion, beginning at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Entrance into <hi>Hierusalem</hi> on <hi>Palm-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> because this was the Beginning and Way to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="26" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's Entrance into <hi>Hierusalem</hi> upon <hi>Palm-Sunday.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE time now drawing near, where our Saviour had Decreed to Offer up himself a Sacrifice for the Salvation of the World; as of his own accord he would be Sacrific'd, so of his own accord he came to the place of Sacrifice, which was the City of <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> to the end, that in the same City, and on the same Day that the Mystical Lamb was Sacrificed, then, and there also the true Lamb might be Offered up; that where so often the Prophets had been slain, there also the Lord of the Prophets might be put to Death; and that where but a few Days before he had been so Honour'd and Applauded, there also he might be Condemn'd and Crucify'd, that so his Passion might be the more Dishonourable, by how much the Place was the more Publick, and the Day the greater Festival. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son having chosen the Village of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> for his Birth, he chose the City of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> for this Sacrifice; that the Glory of his Birth might be hid in the Obscurity of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of his Passion might be the more manifest in the City of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:154273:143"/>2. Our Saviour entring this City, was receiv'd with great Solemnity and Joy, with Olive and Palm Branches, and many spreading their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Way, and all unanimously crying, <hi>Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the Highest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The first Thing that here offers it self to our Consideration, is, the Greatness of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Charity, and the Joy and Readiness wherewith he went to Offer up Himself to Death for us: Since on this Day he would be Receiv'd with such Pomp, in Token of the Joy and Gladness of his Heart, seeing the Hour of our Redemption ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. For if it be said of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apprehended because she was a Christian, she went as joyfully, as if she had been led to a Banquet, for the Honour of God; with how much greater Alacrity and Willingness must we believe he went, who so much excell'd her in Charity and Grace, when he went to perform the Work of our Redemption in Obedience to, and for the Honour of God? By this thou may'st per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with what Willingness and Promptitude thou ought'st to apply thy self to those Things that are for his Service; since he so joyfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Work of thy Redemption: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, That on the one Hand, the Apostle says, That <hi>God delights in the willing Servant;</hi> and on the other, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> says, <hi>Cursed be he that doth the Work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider also the Words of the Prophecy, representing this Publick Entry, which are these: <hi>Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>make Jubilation, O Daughter of</hi> Hierusalem.<note place="margin">Zach. 9.9.</note>
                  <hi>Behold thy King will come unto thee, the Just and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:154273:144"/> himself poor, and riding upon an Ass, and upon a Colt, the Foal of an Ass.</hi> All these are Words of great Comfort; for to say, thy King, and, unto thee; is as much as to say, that this Lord is all thine; and that all his Toils and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are for thee. For thee he Comes, for thee he is Born, for thee he Labours, for thee he Fasts, for thee he Prays, for thee he Lives, for thee he Dies; and for thee he Rises again, and Ascends into Heaven. And be not afraid of the Name of a King, for he is not like the other Kings of the World, who Reign more for their own Advantage, than for the God of their Subjects; Empoverishing them to Enrich themselves; and Exposing their Lives, to Save their Own. But this New King is not to be like them, for he will Enrich thee at his Own Expence, and Defend thee with the Price of his Blood, and give thee Life with the loss of his Own. For to this Effect he saith in St. <hi>John, That Power was given him over all Flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joan. 17.2.</note>
                  <hi>that to all those who are his he may give Life Everlasting.</hi> This is that Principality, whereof the Prophet saith, <hi>It is placed upon the Shoulders of him that hath it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay 9.</note>
                  <hi>and not on the Shoulders of his People;</hi> that the Trouble of the Burden may be His, and the Benefit and Profit Ours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, he says he comes Meek, and sitting upon a contemptible Beast. So that the God of Hosts, he that sits upon the Cherubims, and flies upon the Wings of the Winds, and has Thousands of Choirs of Angels about him, he now comes so Meek and Humble, as is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us. To the end thou may'st no more fly from him, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradise, and as the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> did when he gave them the Law; but rather that thou approach him, seeing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:154273:144"/> of a Lion he is become a Lamb: For he that till now has not Conquer'd thy Heart with the Force of his Power, nor the Greatness of his Majesty; will now Conquer it with the Profoundness of his Humility, and the Strength of his Love. This is the new manner of Fight our Lord made choice of, (as the Holy Prophetess said) and thus he broke down the Gates of his Enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered their Hearts. And this is it that is here figuratively represented to us in this Solemn Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in which (as the Evangelist says) all that City was concern d; and all came out to meet him, some with Olive and Palm-branches, and others spreading their Garments on the Ground, Singing his Praises, and Begging Eternal Salvation. Now what is this else, but that the Holy Ghost here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents to us, how this Lord having before waged War with the World, with Severity, Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and unheard-of Punishments and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet without quite Subduing of it; after he chose this new manner of Fight, and made use of Benefits, not Punishments; of Love, not Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; of Meekness, not Wrath; of Humility, not Poverty; and finally, decreed to Die for Mortals, not to Kill them? Then it was he took Possession of their Hearts, and drew all things to him, as he says in his Gospel; and, <hi>If I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all things unto me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 12.32.</note> Not with the Force of Steel, but with Chains of Love; not with Severity and Punishment, but with Good Works and Benefits. Then Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, some to cut Olive-branches, stripping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their Garments, and bestowing what they had in Works of Piety and Mercy, which is signified by the Olive-Tree; and others went yet farther, spreading their Garments on the Ground,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:154273:145"/> to Adorn the Way through which our Saviour was to pass; these are they, who by the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Will and Appetite, and by the Chastizing of their Flesh, and even the Death of their Bodies, gave Glory to our Lord; as was done by innumerable Martyrs, who suffer'd the Garment of their Bodies to be dragg'd and torn to pieces, for the Glory of God. Here are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us Three Sorts of Virtues, with which we are to go out to meet this Lord, when he comes Spiritually to our Souls. The First is Prayer; represented by those who Prais'd him with their Voices, and Ask'd of him Salvation. The Second is Charity and Mercy; represented by those who Cut Olive-branches; for it has been said already, that the Olive-Tree is the Emblem of Mercy. The Third is the Mortification of the Flesh, and Contempt of our Selves; represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those who Cast their Garments on the Ground, to be trod and trampled on, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ. Of which Virtues, the First, to wit, Prayer, is due to God; the Second, that is, Mercy, to our Neighbour; but the Third, which is Mortification, a Man owes to Himself. These are Three Spiritual Crosses, which a Christian ought always carry on his Shoulders; and when he Rises in the Morning, as soon as he has given Thanks to God, and Recommended to him his Actions of that Day, he must immediately take up these Crosses; that is, these Great Duties, and be all the Day intent to perform them; keeping a Devout Heart towards God, a Merciful one towards his Neighbour, and a very Severe one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Himself; Chastizing his Flesh, Curbing his Tongue, and Mortifying all his Appetites.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:154273:145"/>6. But above all, you have here a great Motive for Despising the Glory of this World, whereof Men are so fond; and for the Purchasing whereof, they commit so many Absurdities. Would you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what Value ought to be put upon this Glory? Look upon the Honour the World does our Lord, and you will see, that the same World which this Day receives him with so much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Six Days after reputed him worse than <hi>Barabbas,</hi> Clamour'd to have him put to Death, and Cry'd out against him, saying, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> So that he who this Day was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd the Son of <hi>David,</hi> that is, the Holiest of all Holy Men; to Morrow is accounted the worst of Men, and more unworthy of Life than <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas.</hi> Now what is there that can more plainly show us how little the Glory of this World is to be valued, and what Account is to be made of the Applause and Esteem of Men? What can be more light, more various, more rash, more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and inconstant, than the Judgment and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of this World? This Day it says, and to Morrow unsays. This Day it extols, and to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Blasphemes; this Day it lifts you above the Clouds, and to Morrow it sinks you into the Abyss; this Day it calls you Son of <hi>David,</hi> and to Morrow says you are worse than <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi> Such is the Nature of this many-headed and deceitful Monster, that it is true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to none, and regards neither Virtue nor Worth any further, than serves its own turn: Only he is Good, who is Prodigal with it, tho' he be a Heathen; and only he is Bad, who treats it according to its Merits, tho' he work Miracles; because the Standard by which it tries Virtue, is its own Interest. Then what shall I say of its
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:154273:146"/> Frauds and Deceits? With whom did it ever keep Promise? With whom was its Friendship lasting? Whom did it long leave possest of what it had bestow'd? On whom did it ever confer the Wine of Delight, without mixing it with the Water of Sorrow? It is only constant in this, that it keeps Faith with none. This is the False <hi>Judas,</hi> who Kissing his Friends, delivers them up to Death. This is the Treacherous <hi>Joab,</hi> who Embracing him he Salutes as a Friend, privately Stabs him in the Body. It promises Delight, and gives Sorrows; declares Peace, and under-hand makes War. It is ill to be preserv'd, worse to be obtain'd, dangerous to be possest, and difficult to be left. O wicked World, false Promiser, sure Deceiver, feigned Friend, certain Enemy, open Flatterer, private Traitor, Sweet in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the End Bitter; of an attractive Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of cruel Hands; sparing of Benefits, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of Sorrows; in Appearance something, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in meer Emptiness; without all Flowers, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath all Thorns.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's Washing the Feet of his Disciples.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Concluding Actions of our Saviour's Life, and his Farewel to his Disciples, before he entred upon his Passion, were, the Washing of their Feet with his own Hands, the Instituting of the most Holy Sacrament of the Altar for them, and the Preaching to them a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:154273:146"/> Sermon full of all imaginable Sweetness, Good Doctrine, and Comfort. For such Grace, and such a Farewel as this, was proper to the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Charity of our Lord. St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist relates the First of these Mysteries, to this Effect, telling us, That,<note place="margin">Joan. 13.1.</note>
                  <hi>Before the Feast of the Passover, Christ knowing that his Hour was come, that he should depart out of this World, unto his Father, having lov'd his own, which were in the World, he lov'd them to the end. And Supper being ended, (the Devil having put it into the Heart of</hi> Judas Iscariot, <hi>to Betray him)</hi> Jesus <hi>knowing that the Father had given all things into his Hands; and that he was come from God, and went to God. He arose from Supper, and laid aside his Garments, and took a Towel and girded himself. After that, he poured Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bason, and began to wash the Disciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded.</hi> Thus far the Words of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now tho' there be many Points worthy our Consideration in this Remarkable Action, the first that occurs, is, this Example of Unspeakable Humility in the Son of God; whose Grandeur the same Evangelist began to declare at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Gospel; that we might the more plainly perceive the Greatness of this Humility, by comparing it with such Supream Majesty. As if he had said, This same Lord who knew all Things, he who was the Son of God, who came from him, and was returning to him; he into whose Hands the Father had given all Things, Heaven, Earth, Hell, Life, Death, Angels, Men, and Devils; and in short, All Things; He, so Great in Majesty, was so Great in Humility, that neither
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:154273:147"/> the height of his Power, made him despise this mean Office, nor the nearness of his Death, caus'd him to forget this Favour; nor the Glory of his Majesty mov'd him to forbear to debase himself to this so lowly piece of Service, which is one of the meanest that Servants use to perform. Therefore as if he had been himself a Servant, he laid by his Garments girt himself, pour'd Water into the Bason, and with his own Hands, with those Hands which created the Heavens, with those Hands into which the Father had deliver'd All Things; he began to Wash the Feet of poor Fishermen, and (what is yet much more) the Feet of the worst of Men; that is, the Feet of the Traitor who had Betrayed him. O Incomprehensible Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! O Wonderful Charity! O Unspeakable Humility of the Son of God! Who is there that will not stand astonish'd, when he beholds the Creator of the World, the Glory of the Angels, the King of Heaven, and the Lord of all the Creation, prostrate at the Feet of Fishermen, but above all, at those of <hi>Judas?</hi> He was not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with only descending from Heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man; but that he descended yet lower, (as the Apostle says) annihilating and humbling himself in such manner, that being in the Form of God, he took upon him not only the Form of Man, but also of a Slave, doing the Office of Slaves. The Pharisee who invited Christ, admir'd that he suffer'd a Sinful Woman to touch his Feet, thinking it below the Dignity of a Prophet. Now if thou think'st it so unworthy a thing, O Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, that a Prophet suffer his Feet to be touch'd by a Sinful Woman; what would'st thou do, if thou believed'st this same Lord was God, and yet suffer'd his Feet to be touch'd by that Sinful
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:154273:147"/> Woman? And if thou wert highly astonished at that, tell me, I beseech thee, what could'st thou do, if believing that this Lord was God, (as he really was) thou sawest not only his Feet touch'd by Sinners, but himself prostrate on the Ground, Washing the Feet of Sinners? How much greater is God, than a Prophet; and how much more is it for him to Wash the Feet of others, than to suffer his own to be Touch'd? Then how much more would'st thou stand astonish'd, if thou sawest, and hadst Faith in this Wonder? I verily believe the Angels themselves were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and amaz'd at this Stupendious Humility.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He laid aside his Garments,</hi> (says the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O Ingratitude! O Misery of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! God removes all Impediments, to serve Man; then why shall not Man remove them, to serve God? If Heaven thus bows down to Earth, why shall not the Earth incline to Heaven? If the Abyss of Mercy thus stoops to the Abyss of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; why shall not the Abyss of Misery fall down to the Abyss of Mercy? He himself it was that Girt himself, that Pour'd Water into the Bason, and Wash'd the Feet of the Disciples; to the end, that by this, the Lovers of Virtue, and those who have the Charge of Souls, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, That they are not to commit to others the Works of Mercy, but that they themselves must put their Hands to every thing. For if Man desires the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for himself, and not for another; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is to do the Works of Virtue, and not by Proxy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider also how aptly this Action was plac'd, when our Lord did it. For then the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples began to dispute, which of them was Greatest: This same Dispute they had once before among themselves, and it was not yet allay'd by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:154273:148"/> what our Saviour then said to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he now apply'd a more powerful Remedy, that is, his Example, doing in their Presence, and for their Service, this Work of such Profound Humility; besides those he had before perform'd, and was to perform. For our Lord well knew how necessary this Virtue is to Man, and how irksom it was to him; and therefore he apply'd this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Medicine, to remove this Loathing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But he left us not here an Example of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alone, but also of Charity; for to Wash the Feet is not only a Service, but a special Act of Friendship, which our Saviour did to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Day before his own Feet were to be nail'd to the Cross, and bath'd in Blood; that thou may'st perceive how severe Charity is to it self, and how tender to others. This Example of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Charity our Lord leaves in his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a Legacy to his Children; recommending to them at that last Hour, that they should Treat one another, as he had Treated them; and should do to one another the same Kindnesses and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that he had done to them. Now what more fit Law, or Commandment, than this, could be expected from that Heart which was fill'd with Charity and Mercy? What Commandment can a Father leave to the Children he dearly loves, at the Hour of his Death, but, That they Love one another; and Do to one another, as he has done to them. This Command Holy <hi>Joseph</hi> gave to his Brethren, when he sent them to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, saying, <hi>Do not Contend by the way; travel in Peace, and do not hurt one another.</hi> This was the Command of a true Brother, who sincerely lov'd his Brothers, and desir'd their good. Now our Lord to express this same Love towards Men,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:154273:148"/> gives us here the same Commandment, (which for its excellency is absolutely call'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment) wherein he gives us in Charge the thing that is most for our Peace, for our Good, and for our Comfort. Insomuch, that if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment were observ'd in the World, doubtless Men would live in it, as it were in a Paradice. Where you may also observe, what sort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments they are that God imposes on us; for they are of that Nature, and so Advantageous to Man, that, rightly consider'd, we owe more to him for what he Commands us, than he to us for keeping his Commandments; for even laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Reward of Heaven, nothing in this World would be Commanded us that were more for our Advantage.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Institution of the most Holy Sacrament.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AMong all the Demonstrations of Charity, which our Lord gave us, whilst in this World, the Institution of the Blessed Sacrament is deservedly reputed one of the most signal. Whereupon S. <hi>John</hi> says, that <hi>Our Lord having lov'd his own, which were in the World,</hi> (that is, his Elect) <hi>he lov'd them unto the end;</hi> and then more remarkably, for at that time he bestow'd greater Benefits on them, and gave them greater Tokens of his Love. Now for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Words, which are the Ground of this Mystery, as well as of all those that follow, it must be granted that no Tongue can express the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:154273:149"/> greatness of the Love Christ bore his Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and consequently to Men, as given by him into his Charge. For the Benefits which our Lord, as he was Man, had receiv'd from his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, being Infinite, and the Grace of his Soul (whence Charity proceeds) being also In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, it follows that the Love which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to those Benefits and Grace, was so great, that no Human, or even Angelical Understanding, can Comprehend it. Now whereas it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Love, to desire to Suffer for the lov'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; hence it is, that it is impossible to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the greatness of the desire Christ had to Drink the Chalice of Death, and to Suffer for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Men, which he so much Coveted for their Love. This Divine Love, which till now had been, as it were, held in, and curb'd from doing what it desir'd, and could do, was now set at liberty to act, do, and suffer, whatever it would for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Man. Being thus set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the first thing it did, was to admit all the Pains and Sufferings of his Passion, that they might, all together, first attack his Soul with the apprehension of them, and then seize his most Holy Body. Such were these Pains, that the very imagination of them was sufficient to make him sweat Drops of Blood. This Love it was which deliver'd him into the Hands of Sinners, which ty'd him to a Pillar, which crown'd him with Thorns, which made him carry the Cross, and at last nail'd him upon it. This Love it was that made him deliver up his Hands to be bound, his Cheeks to be buffetted, his Beard to be torn, his Back to be scourg'd, his Hands and Feet to be nail'd, his Side to be pierc'd; and in short, all
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:154273:149"/> his Members and Sences to be Tormented for our sake. By this it is we are to weigh our Saviour's Sufferings, not by the fury of his Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Rage was not equal to his Love, or by the multitude of our Sins, which one Drop of his Blood was sufficient to have blotted out, but by the greatness of this Love. But it was this same Love which mov d him to Institute an Admirable Sacrament, which, whatsoever way you regard it, casts forth inestimable Rays of Love. Therefore he that desires to know the greatness of this Love, must cast his Eyes upon this Divine Sacrament, and consider its Effects, and the Purposes for which it was Instituted; for these things will inform him of the wonderful Charity which inflam'd that Breast whence this Sacrament proceeded. For all Signs and Tokens of true and perfect Love are found in this Divine Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first Sign and Act of true Love, is to desire to be United, and become the same thing with the lov'd Object. Whence it is, that he who Loves, has all his Faculties bent upon the thing he Loves, as his Understanding, Memory, Will, Imagination, and the rest. So that Love is an Alienation and Banishment from one's self, which proceeds from a Man's being wholly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and chang'd into the Belov'd Object. This so principal an Effect of Love Christ shew'd to us in the Institution of this Sacrament; for one of the Ends for which it was Instituted, was to Incorporate and Make us the same thing with him, and therefore he Instituted it in the Form of Food; that as of the Food, and him that Eats it, one same Substance is made, so also there might be the same Substance of Christ, and him who worthily receives him, as he himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:154273:150"/> it, saying, <hi>He that Eats my Flesh, and Drinks my Blood, is in me, and I in him.</hi> Which is done by a participation of the same Spirit, which dwells in both; which is, as if both had one Heart and one Soul, whence follows one same manner of Life, and after that the same Glory, tho' in different Degrees. Then what is there more to be Valu'd or Esteem'd, than this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The second Sign and true Act of Love, is to do good to the Person Belov'd, and share with it all that one has, after giving it one's Heart, and one's self. For true Love is never Idle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Works, and Labours to do Good to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Belov'd. Now what greater Good, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gifts, than what Christ bestows on us in this Sacrament? In it we have the very Flesh and Blood of Christ, and the Benefit reap'd by the Sacrifice of this Flesh and Blood. So that here we have the Honey, together with the Honey-Comb; that is, Christ, with his Merits and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, whereof he now makes us Partakers, by Virtue of this Sacrament, according to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Preparation of him that receives it. So that, even our Soul, when God has Created and Infus'd it, no sooner touches the Flesh, which descends from <hi>Adam,</hi> but it partakes of the Sins and Miseries of <hi>Adam;</hi> even so, on the contrary, no sooner by the Means of this Sacrament, it touches the Flesh of Christ, but it partakes of all the Merits and Treasures of Christ. For which reason this Sacrament is called Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in it God Communicates to us, not only his Precious Flesh and Blood, but also all the Merits and Sufferings of the Sacrifice of that same Flesh and Blood.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:154273:150"/>4. The third Sign and Act of Love, is to desire always to live in the Memory of the Person Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, and to require always to be thought on; and to this purpose, Lovers, when they part, give one another some Tokens to refresh the Memory. For this reason also our Saviour Instituted this Sacrament, that in his Absence it might be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Holy Passion, and of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Therefore when he had Instituted it, he said, Every time you do this, do it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. That is, to remember how much I Lov'd you, how much I Valu'd you, and how much I Suffer'd for you. What can we judge of his Love, who gave such Tokens for us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him by? But true Love is not satisfied with the bare Remembrance, it requires also a Return of Love; for it looks upon all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitals, as of no Value, if compar'd with this; and sometimes this desire is so earnest, that it lays Baits and Allurements to attract this Love, where it believes it is wanting. So far extended the wonderful Love of God, for desiring to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by us, he Instituted this Mysterous Bait, Consecrated with such Words, that he who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily Receives it, is immediately touch'd with this Love. Now what can be more astonishing than this?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fourth Sign and Act of Love, when it is a tender Love, is to desire to give Content and Satisfaction to the Person lov'd, and to use all the Means that may conduce to it, as Parents do to their little Children, seeking all things that may please and divert them. This same was done by the Sovereign Lover of Man, in the Institution of this Sacrament; whose Property it is to give Spiritual Comfort and Repast to pure and clean
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:154273:151"/> Souls, <hi>Which in it receive</hi> (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) <hi>so great Content and Satisfaction, that it is not to be express'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider, I beseech thee, what a time our Saviour chose to prepare for us this delightful Morsel, to wit, the Night preceding his Passion, when the greatest Pains and Sufferings in the World were preparing for him. So that when Sufferings were providing for him, he provided Delights for us; when Gall was prepar'd for him, he prepar'd Honey for us; when Torments were made ready for him, he made ready Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies for us; and even the presence of Death, and so many Sufferings as attended him, could not so possess his Heart, as to withdraw him from bestowing on us this signal Benefit. With great reason is it said, that Love is strong as Death, since the many Waters, and great Inundations of Pains and Sufferings, were not of force to quench, nor so much as to darken the Flame of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The last Sign and Act of Love, is to desire the Presence of the Person Belov'd, as not able to endure the Pain of Absence. This is plainly to be seen in the sad Complaints of <hi>Tobias</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the absence of her Son, and in what the Holy Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> did, for the sight of <hi>Joseph;</hi> for being 130 Years of Age, he set out with his whole Family for <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he might see before he Dy'd him his Heart so entirely Lov'd. For it is the Nature of true Love, to Covet to have that always present which it Loves, and always to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its Company. For this reason this Divine Lover Instituted this Admirable Sacrament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is Really and Substantially; to the end that this Sacrament being in the World, he might also
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:154273:151"/> remain with us in the World, tho' he went away into Heaven. Which is an absolute Argument of his Love, and of the Earnestness wherewith he coveted our Company; for the greatness of this Love could not bear so long an Absence.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That he did this for us, was the greatest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the greatest Benefit, the greatest Comfort, and the greatest Support that could have been left us in this World; that in him we might have one to fly to, one to call upon in our Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and one to speak to Face to Face, when we were in Distress; whose Presence might rouze our Devotion, increase our Reverence, strengthen our Hope, and inflame our Love. <hi>Moses</hi> extoll'd the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note>
                  <hi>There was no Nation in the World so great, that had gods so near it, as our God was to our Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. If he said so before the Institution of this Divine Sacrament, what would he say now, when in it, and by it, we have God in Presence, who sees us, and we see him, and with whom we Confer Face to Face? Doubtless it was a singular favour of our Lord to Institute this Sacrament, that we might receive him within us; but it was much greater, that he was pleas'd we should always have him with us in the Holy Places. Thrice happy the Christians, who every Day can Visit these Places, Appear before this Lord, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him Face to Face. Yet much more happy the Priests, and Religious Men, who dwell in the Churches, and can enjoy his Presence Day and Night, and speak familiarly with God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus it appears, That all the Signs and Acts of perfect Love are comprehended in this Divine Sacrament, and all of them in the highest Degree of Perfection. So that there is no shadow
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:154273:152"/> of Reason to doubt of the Greatness of this Love, since it is so plainly, and so convincingly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us. Whence you may infer, That God is as Great as his Love, as in all his other Works. For as he is Great in Rewarding, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, and Punishing, so also he is in Loving. What greater Treasure, what greater Satisfaction than this could we have? For without doubt, speaking in the strictest Sense, the greatest Good our Lord can do to any Creature, is to Love it. For Love (as Divines say) is the first Gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on it; whence proceed all other Gifts, as Brooks from the Spring, or as Effects from the Cause. Allowing this to be so, what greater Riches or Comfort can the true Servants of God receive, than to know that he loves them? For tho' this cannot be positively demonstrated, unless by Divine Revelation; nevertheless there may be very good Grounds to believe it; which they have, who live long without Mortal Sin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This is a sufficient Ground for very great Spiritual Consolation, and not only for Consolation, but also to become inflamed in the Love of God, and to hope in him. For as nothing makes Fire more intense, than adding to it another Fire; so nothing can more inflame our Love, than the vehemency of his Love. And as nothing can more strengthen our Confidence, than to know, that he Loves us who is able to Relieve us; so there can be no Confidence so assured, as in him who we know has so Entire an Affection for us. What can he deny, who gave himself? And who so En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Lov'd us, since the First of all Gifts is Love? There is yet one thing more, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates the Greatness of this Love. For it were not so much to give this great Gift to such
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:154273:152"/> as Deserv'd, or would be Thankful for it, or would make their Advantage of it; but to give it to many, who so little Understand the Value of it, who are so Ungrateful, and who make so little of it, this is an Act of singular Mercy and Charity. Thou hadst Decreed, O Lord, to make Known to the World the Greatness of thy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and thou mad'st choice of the most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Way to do it: For to this end thou soughtest out so Ungrateful and Unworthy a Creature as I am, that the Excess of thy Grace might be by so much the more Eminent, by how much the Creature was more unworthy. Painters, to set off a Figure that is all White, draw it upon Black, that so the contrary Colours may appear the more, being put together. Even so didst thou, O Lord, bestow this Wonderful Grace on so Unworthy a Creature as Man; that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness of the Creature might the more set off the Wonderfulness of thy Grace. What is there, O King of Glory, in this Man, that thou Lov'st him so much, and wilt be so much Belov'd by him? O Wonder of Wonders! If all thy Being and Glory depended on Man, (as all that Man is and has depends on thee) what more couldst thou have done than thou didst, to be Belov'd by him? It is indeed very much to be Admir'd, that whereas all my Safety, my Glory, and my Felicity depends on thee, yet I fly from thee; and though thou hast so little Need of me, yet thou dost so much for Love of me.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Nor are the <hi>Species,</hi> under which our Lord was pleas'd to remain among us, a less Argument of his Charity; for had he remain'd among us in his own Form, he had remain'd only to be VVor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hip'd; but remaining in the Form of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:154273:153"/> Bread, he remains to be Eaten and Worship'd, that so we might exercise both our Faith and Charity. And he is call'd the Bread of Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is Life it self, under the shape of Bread; therefore ordinary Bread by little and little gives Life to him that eats it, after several Digestions: But he who eats this Bread worthily, in a Moment receives Life, because he eats Life it self. So that if thou dread'st this Bread, because it is Living, approach to it, because it is Bread; and if thou value it little, because it is Bread; have it in great esteem, because it it Living.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AFter the Mysterious Supper, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon our Saviour deliver'd at the Table, the Evangelists say, <hi>He went out to Pray in the Garden of</hi> Gethsemani, before he entred upon the Conquest of his Passion. VVhere you may observe, how after this Supper was ended, and with it the Sacrifices of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Abolish'd, by Instituting those of the <hi>New,</hi> our Saviour gave way to all the Pains and Sufferings of his Passion, that they might all together seize upon his Soul, before they tormented his Body. Therefore the Evangelists say, <hi>He took with him three of his best beloved Disciples, and began to fear, and be
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:154273:153"/> in anguish, and said to them,</hi> those most sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words, <hi>My Soul is sad unto Death;</hi> that is, full of Mortal Sorrow, powerful enough to cause Death; had he not preserv'd Life for greater Sufferings. <hi>And going aside a little from them, he went to Prayer;</hi> and the third time he Pray'd, his Blessed Soul endured such Anguish and Agony, as none in this World ever endur'd. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable by those Precious Drops of Blood which gush'd out over all his Body; for this strange sort of Sweat, never before seen in the World, proves this to have been the greatest Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Agony in the World. For who ever heard or read of a Bloody Sweat that could trickle down to the Ground. And since this outward Sweat, was a Token of the inward Agony of his Soul; as since the Creation of the World there was never such a Sweat, even so there was never such Sorrow. To make it such, there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Causes. The First, was the most perfect <hi>Idea</hi> he there conceiv'd of all the Pains and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings prepar'd for him; which were there so distinctly represented to him, that he was (if we may so term it) there inwardly Scourg'd, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, Spit upon, Crown'd, Reproach'd, and Crucifi'd; and consequently he suffered in the Affective Part of his Soul most excessive Pains, suitable to the Representation of all those several Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was also another more powerful Cause; which was the Grief and Sorrow he endur'd by the Representation of all our Sins. Because, since he in his Infinite Charity Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up himself to Satisfie for them, it was reasonable, that before the Satisfaction, he should undergo this great Sorrow. To this purpose, he
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:154273:154"/> brought before his Eyes all the Crimes and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the VVorld, as well those Committed, as those that were not yet Perpetrated; as well those of the Elect, as those of the Reprobate; and they all caus'd in him a Grief as great, as was his Charity and Zeal for his Father's Honour: So that as his Love and Zeal cannot be measur'd, so neither can his Sorrow. For if <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>He pin'd and wither'd, when he saw the Sins of of Men against God,</hi> what must we judge of him, who had so much greater Charity than <hi>David,</hi> and saw so much more VVickedness than <hi>David;</hi> having before him the Sins of all Ages, past, present, and to come? These were the Bulls and Mad Dogs, that tore his most Holy Soul, more cruel than those that tormented his Body; whereof he said in the Psalm,<note place="margin">Ps. 21.13.</note>
                  <hi>Many Calves have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me, fat Bulls have besieged me.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was one Principal Cause of his Sorrow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Cause, was the Sin and Destruction of that People, which was to be so rigorously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd for that horrid Crime; which doubtless our Lord was much more griev'd at, than at his Death. This was the Chalice which our Blessed Lord refused, (according to the Exposition of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>) when he begged of his Father, that if it were possible, he might ordain some other Means for the Redemption of the VVorld; so that his Ancient People might not commit so great a Crime, and be destroy'd. These and the like Considerations, so afflicted his Blessed Soul in Prayer, that they caus'd him to shed that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Sweat. O Sweet Jesus, O Merciful Lord, what great Affliction is this? VVhat heavy Burden: VVhat strange Disease is it, that thus makes thee Sweat Drops of Blood? The Disease,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:154273:154"/> O Lord, is ours; but thou tak'st upon thee the Pain. The Disease is ours, but thou receiv'st all the bitter Potions. Thou underwent'st a Regular Diet, due to our Gluttony, when thou didst Fast for us. Thou didst suffer the Bleeding our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases requir'd, when thou didst shed thy Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood. Thou also didst receive the Purge that belong'd to our Enormities, when thou didst drink the Vinegar and Gall: And thou now dost suffer the Pain, when being in a Mortal Agony, thou sweatedst Drops of Blood. What return can we make, O Lord, for this Cure, which is so costly to the Physician, and so cheap to the Patient?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider then, poor Mortal, how great the Debt is thou owest to this Lord; behold in what a Condition he is for thee, beset with so much Anguish, strugling and fainting under the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of Death; going and coming from the Disciples to the Father, and from the Father to the Disciples, and finding no Comfort in either Place; for the Father heard not the Prayer that was offer'd up in behalf of Christ's most Innocent Flesh; and the Disciples at this time, slept. <hi>Judas,</hi> and the High-Priests arm'd with Rage and Envy, watch'd: But above all, he was forsaken by Himself; for he received no manner of Comfort from the Superior Part of his Soul, nor from his Divinity. Thus it appears, the Divine Father gave to his Beloved Son to drink the Chalice of his Passion, without the least mixture of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; which was the reason of those Words of the Psalmist, <hi>Thy Wraths have passed upon me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 87.17.</note>
                  <hi>and thy Terrors have troubled me.</hi> He says right, they pass'd, and did not last; for be deserv'd not the Wrath as a Sinner, but as
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:154273:155"/> one that Answer'd for, and was the Saviour of Sinners.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Who laid on thy Shoulders, most Holy Lamb, this Heavy Burden, the only Imagination whereof made thee Sweat Drops of Blood? Who has wounded thee, O Lord? What Blood is that which falls from thy Face? I see no Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners here to torment thee; here are not Signs of Scourges, of Nails, of Thorns, or of the Cross. I guess, my God, thy Charity has resolv'd to be the first shall draw Blood from thee, without the help of Steel or Iron; that it may appear, it is she who makes way for all thy other Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In this Doleful Mystery, Dear Christian, thou hast not only Subject for Meditation, but also an Example of Prayer. For here in the first place, our Saviour teaches us to have Recourse to God in all our Wants, as to the Father of Mercy; who sometimes gives us Afflictions, as Motives to excite us to have Recourse to him, and make Trial of his Fatherly Providence in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. He also teaches us here to persevere in Prayer, and not to desist, or give over our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, when we are not presently heard, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our desire; but that nevertheless we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as our Saviour did; who three times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the same Prayer, because very often what is deny'd at the beginning, is granted at the latter end He also teaches us here to Pray, with great Confidence on the one hand, and with great Submission and Resignation to God's VVill on the other. He teaches us to Confide, when he says, <hi>Father;</hi> which is a VVord that expresses all possible Tenderness and Assurance, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for him that Prays. And he teaches
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:154273:155"/> us Resignation, saying, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Apprehending of our Saviour.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the next place, consider, how after this Prayer was ended, presently came that Troop of Arm'd Men, and among them many of the Priests and Pharisees, to Apprehend the Lamb. For they durst not rely upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Officers and hir'd Souldiers, (lest it should fall out, as it did once before, when they were converted by our Saviour's Preaching, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd empty-handed) but they themselves came in Person, as relying on their own Malice, which was so inveterate, that they never expected they should forsake their VVickedness, or be mov'd at any Preaching or Miracles. So that they who were greatest in Dignity, when they were corrupted, became greatest in VVickedness. VVhence you may gather, That as of the best VVine, when it decays, the best Vinegar is made; so those who by their Profession are more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and Nearest to God, (such as are all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons, and others Dedicated to God) when they are deprav'd, become worse than all other Men; as the Supream Angel when he fell, became the Head of Devils.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Judas</hi> came as Leader and Commander in Chief of this Party, being fallen, like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> from the highest Dignity of the Church, into the deepest Abyss of Wickedness, which was to be the first that Conspir'd the Death of Christ. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:154273:156"/> into what a wonderful depth of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness this Wretch was plung'd, by not resisting his first Temptations of Covetousness. Wo be unto thee, if thou resist not thine: For what can be expected from thee, who hast not such Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Virtue, as he had? Thou hast not such a Master, thou seest not such Miracles, nor dost thou Converse with such Disciples. What then canst thou expect from thy self, unless thou watch thy self on all Hands? The Traitor had given them a Sign, saying, <hi>Whomsoever I shall Kiss, that is he, lay hold on him.</hi> With what other Token should they lay Snares for the most Loving Master, and Fountain of Charity and Love? What other Sign should they give to apprehend him, but the Sign of Love?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Lord accepted of this cruel Kiss, that the Sweetness of his Meek Reception might soften that Obdurate Heart, but all Medicines are cast away upon an obstinate and perverse Mind. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thou, my Soul, that if this most Sweet Lamb did not refuse the false Kiss of him that cruelly Betray'd him, much less can he despise the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kiss of him, who cordially Loves him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet to convince Human Arrogance, that it was of no force against the Divine Omnipotency, before they laid Hands on him, with only a word he struck down to the Ground those Infernal Bands, tho' they, as Men blinded and hardned in Malice, were not Converted, even with this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, to shew thee how far a Man runs to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, when he is forsaken by God, and how Incurable he is, whom he doth not Cure, since this powerful Medicine had no Effect on him, who had forsaken Christ. Curse be that obstinate Rage, which submitted not at the sight of so great
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:154273:156"/> a Miracle, and was not mollify'd by so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a Benefit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But our Lord shew'd not only his Power here, but his Mercy also, restoring to its place the Ear which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had Cut off. Where we may also consider the words our Saviour spoke to St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon this occasion. <hi>Put thy Sword,</hi> says he, <hi>into its place. The Chalice which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has given me, wilt not thou that I drink it?</hi> This is the Armour that every Christian is to make use of, for his defence in all his Troubles and Afflictions, for they are the Chalice the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father gives us to drink, to try and exercise us. Holy <hi>Job</hi> confessed it, when seeing himself Afflicted and Molested by Satan, he said: <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, as it pleased the Lord, so it was done, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> The same <hi>David</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when <hi>Semei</hi> Cursed him, saying, <hi>God had Commanded him to Curse him.</hi> And since all these are the Cups of the Heavenly Father, there is no reason to fear the Potion prescrib'd by such a Wise Physician, who is a Father in his Actions, as well as his Name; nor is there any cause to dread the Bitterness of the Cup, since the Sweet Lips of the Son of God (in whom was the Fulness of Grace) were imprinted on it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After the Cure of the Ear, the Disciples fly, and forsake our Lord. They accompany'd him at Supper, and left him alone in his Passion. In this we all follow the Example of the Disciples, for we all fly from Sufferings, and forbear to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, when he Goes towards the Cross, and yet we desire to follow him, when he Travels towards his Kingdom. And if perchance some time we follow him, it is at a distance (as the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:154273:157"/> Disciples follow'd) that is, exposing our selves to very little Trouble for him. But alas, my God, they fled from thee, because of the Danger they saw, but I fly without Danger, and not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger, but also seeing the Danger I run into by departing from thee; for to depart from thee, is to depart from the Light, from Life, from Peace, and from all that is Good. Then how much greater is my Crime, than theirs?</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Disciples having forsaken our Lord, all that Herd of Bloody Wolves set upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted Lamb, who was left alone in their Power. But who can hear without being mov'd, how those cruel Villains stretched out their Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hands, and bound the Hands of that most Meek Lord, who neither contradicted nor resisted them? What a Sight was it to behold how they hastily Dragg'd him Bound, with Shouts, and a multitude of Rabble, through the most noted Streets, to the House of the High-Priest. What Sorrow then possess'd his Disciples, when they saw their most Loving Master taken from them, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away after this manner, and betray'd by one of them; since the Traitor himself was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at the ill he had done, that he Despair'd, and Hang'd himself. Then, who could be so hard-hearted as not to be mov'd to Compassion, seeing so Holy a Lord, who had done so much good in that Countrey, casting out Devils, healing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and teaching such Wonderful Doctrine, seeing him Dragg'd with such Violence through the Streets, with a Cord about his Neck, his Hands bound, and with so much Disgrace? O cruel Hearts, how comes it that so much Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness does not move you to Compassion? How can you do harm to him, who has done you so much
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:154273:157"/> good? How comes it you do not at least regard that Innocence and Meekness, since being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by so many Wrongs, he neither Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, nor Complains, nor is Angry at so many Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts.</p>

               <head type="sub">How our Saviour was brought before the Two High-Priests, <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and of his Sufferings during that Night.</head>
               <p n="1">1. OUR Lord being thus Apprehended, they lead him with Shouts and Cries to the House of <hi>Annas,</hi> because he was Father-in law to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> who was High-Priest for that Year. Consider in the first place, the horrid Affront our Saviour endur'd in the House of this wicked Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law to the High-Priest. For being ask'd about his Doctrine and Disciples; and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, that he had taught Men openly, and that by them he might be inform'd; one of the Servants of this wicked Man, gave our Lord a Buffet, saying, <hi>Dost thou so answer the High-Priest?</hi> Consider how the wicked Priest, and those that were about him, Scoffed to see our Lord so struck; and on the other side, how they that were his followers were Afflicted, not being able to bear so great an Injury offer'd to a Person of that Worth. Consider also, with what Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Meekness he spoke to him that struck him, saying, <hi>If I have spoken ill, shew in what, and if well, why strikest thou me?</hi> As if he had
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:154273:158"/> plainly said, Thou hast much wrong'd me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my giving thee any occasion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider in the next place, how thence was carry'd to the House of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and what Injuries he sustain'd, when he answer'd the Question of the High-Priest, who ask'd him, <hi>Who he was.</hi> For there, not only one, but many that were present, ran upon the Holy Lamb, like ravenous Wolves, and struck him without any Compassion. Some Buffeted, others Spit in his Face, others Tore his Hair, and others Revil'd and Blasphem'd him. So that that Countenance which is Ador'd by the Angels, and is the Joy of the Heavenly Kingdom, is here Spit upon by those Infernal Mouths, Buffeted, Scoffed at, and Cover'd with a Veil in derision. In short, the Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here treated like a Blasphemer, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Person, whilst he Suffers all those Wrongs with a Meek and Serene Countenance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And tho' all this be Matter of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, that is not a less Motive of Pity, which S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates, saying, <hi>That this same Night the Soldiers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note>
                  <hi>who guarded him, were Scoffing at him, Covering his Face, and Striking him, saying, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to us, O Christ, who it was that struck thee.</hi> And they spoke many Blasphemies against him, which the Gospel does not mention; yet from our Lord's Patience and Charity, and from the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Rage of those fierce Hearts, set on by the Devil, we may infer, what a Night our Saviour had among those Savage Executioners.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's being brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and Scourged at the Pillar: Being the Second Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THis dismal Night being pass'd over, amidst so many Contumelies in the House of the High-Priest, the next Morning they carry'd our Lord Bound to the House of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd that Province for the <hi>Romans;</hi> earnestly pressing, that he should Condemn him to Death. Whilst they with Clamours Accus'd him, and laid to his Charge a Thousand false and forged Crimes, he stood (like a quiet Lamb before him that shears him) amidst all this Noise and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, without excusing or defending himself, and without answering one Word; insomuch that the Judge himself was astonished at his Gravity and Silence, amidst those Cries and Distraction. And tho' <hi>Pilate</hi> knew that nothing but Envy had incens'd that Multitude, yet being overcome by Fear, he commanded the Innocent Lamb to be Scourg'd; thinking by this means to appease the Rage of his Enemies. No sooner was this cruel Order given, than the wicked Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners laid hold, and stripping our Lord of his Garments, they ty'd him to a Pillar, and began to Scourge and Tear that most pure Flesh; to add Scourges to Scourges, Wounds to Wounds, and Sores to Sores. The Streams of Blood ran down his Sacred Back, and moisten'd the Ground about him. What could be more Injurious, or a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of greater Compassion. For Whipping is not a Punishment for Men of Birth and Repute, but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:154273:159"/> only for Slaves, Thieves, and Publick Malefactors. For which Reason, the <hi>Romans</hi> had established a Law, that no Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> should be Whip'd for any Crime; because this was the most Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous sort of Punishment. Therefore it is, that <hi>Cicero</hi> severely inveighs against the Cruelty of a Judge, who had caus'd a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Whip'd; whilst he seeing himself wrong'd, cry'd, <hi>I am a Citizen of</hi> Rome. Now if it was so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a Fault to Whip a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, do thou consider, O my Soul! what a sight it is to see the Lord of the Creation ty'd to a Pillar, and cruelly Scourg'd, like a common Malefactor? What can we think the Angels did, who so well knew the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of this Lord, seeing him thus Scourg'd, and Torn? What can this mean, my God? What Punishment, what Penance is this? What Crimes hast thou committed, my Lord, to be thus Scourg'd? It is a plain Case, my Saviour, that my Sins and my Crimes are the Cause of these Stripes, and not thine. For, as out of the Excess of thy Charity, thou took'st upon thee my Human Nature, so also with it thou took'st upon thee the Debts and Payments which it was liable to, and therefore thou endurest these Torments. These plainly discover who thou art, and who I am; who I am, that committed such Crimes, as to deserve such Punishment; and who thou art, whose Charity was so great, as to take upon thee such Offences. What the number of these Stripes was, is not set down by the Evangelists, but it is expressed by the Multitude of our Sins, and the Cruelty of those Infernal Furies, who took such Delight in our Saviour's Blood and Sufferings. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then, Unhappy Man, who art the Cause of all these Wounds, how great Cause thou hast to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:154273:159"/> Love, Fear, and Hope in this Lord, and to take Compassion on him. Thou hast Cause to Love, seeing how much he Suffer'd for thee; Cause to Fear, seeing how severely he Punish'd thy Sins in his own Person; Cause to Hope, seeing how plentiful Satisfaction he has made for them; and Cause for Compassion, considering the Excessive Pains he endur'd, and how much Blood he here shed.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's being Crown'd with Thorns: Being the Third Sorrowful Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi> And of his being shown to the People.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NO sooner was the Cruel Scourging ended, but another Torture no less Painful than that, was put in Practice, which was the Crowning with Thorns. For when they had done Tormenting our Lord with Stripes, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list says,<note place="margin">Joan. 19.</note>
                  <hi>The Souldiers came to Scoff at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Sufferings, and platting a Crown of Thorns, they put it upon his Head;</hi> that at the same time he might suffer cruel Pain, and the greatest Contempt. Many of the Thorns broke in entring his Head, others (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) pierced the Scull, and tore the very Brain. And yet not satisfi'd with this Inhuman Scorn, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in a Purple Garment, then us'd by Kings, and putting a Reed instead of a Scepter into his Hand, they Kneel'd down, Buffeted, and Spit on his Divine Face; and then taking the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:154273:160"/> Reed out of his Hands, they struck him with it on the Head, saying, <hi>Hail, King of the</hi> Jews. It seems almost impossible, that Human Hearts could invent such Cruelties; for they were such, that had they been exercis'd upon the worst of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they would move the hardest Heart to Compassion: But it being the Devil who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and God that Suffer'd; neither could that Inveterate Malice be Satiated with any Torments, so violent was their Hatred; nor could this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be Satisfied with less Sufferings, such was the vehemency of his Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I cannot decide, whether the Pain our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour endur'd at this time, or the Affront put upon him, was greatest. For we daily see Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors expos'd to Shame in Pillories, or other like manners, but these neither draw Blood, nor cause Pain. But who ever saw or heard of a Crown of Thorns thrust through the Scull, being at once so great an Ignominy, and so violent a Pain? Thus it appears, the Savage Cruelty of these Executioners was not satisfi'd with such Torments as had been known and us'd in all Ages; but it found out new sorts of Tortures, never before seen; which might at once Disgrace, and also Torment and Afflict the Person. What shall I say of the other Circumstances, wherewith they yet heightned the Bitterness of this Pain; as the Cloathing him in a Purple Garment, like a King; the putting a Reed into his Hand, instead of a Scepter; the Kneeling before him in Scorn, the Striking him on the Head with the Reed, and and Buffeting his Divine Countenance? When was there ever seen, since the Creation of the World, such an Invention, such Pastime, such Cruel and Bloody Sport? We read nothing like
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:154273:160"/> it, either in the Combats of Martyrs, or in the Punishments of Malefactors; wherein tho' many sorts of Cruelty were exercis'd, yet there were not these Bitter Inventions of Aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. All this was reserv'd for our Lord; who being to make Satisfaction for the Sins of Men, paid for our Luxury, with his Pains; and for our Pride, with the Dishonour of these Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies. This shows us the Greatness of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Charity, which was not satisfi'd to Die any sort of Death; but chose the most Bitter, most Ignominious and Scandalous Sort that could be imagin'd, and would have all those different Sorts of Affronts concur in it, to make his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the more visible, and render our Redemption the more full. Now that this was the Effect of his Infinite Goodness and Charity, is demonstrated by this Reason; for it is certain, that the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Charity of Christ was greater than the Malice and Hatred of the Devil: Then if this Malice and Hatred could invent these Cruelties, the Goodness and Charity of Christ was much more sufficient, not only to suffer, but also to desire them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Pilate</hi> being fully satisfi'd of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Innocency, and seeing that it was no Guilt of his, but the Envy of his Enemies, that must condemn him, he try'd all ways to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him out of their Hands. To this purpose, he thought it sufficient to Expose him as he was, to be seen by the inrag'd Multitude; for he was in such a Condition, that the Judge believ'd the very Sight of him was enough to quell the Fury of their Hearts. Do thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, O my Soul, to be present at this Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectacle; and, as if thou wert actually there,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:154273:161"/> observe attentively in what a Posture our Lord, who is the Brightness of his Father's Glory, and the Mirror of his Beauty, was brought out to be seen by the People. Consider with what Shame he stood there in the midst of that Multitude, with his Garment of Scorn; his Hands bound, his Crown of Thorns, the Reed in his Hand, his Body torn with Stripes, and all bloody, gor'd, and torn. Consider how that Divine Face look'd, being swell'd with Buffets, deform'd with Spittle, scratch'd with the Thorns, and cover'd with Blood, in some places fresh, and in others setl'd and black. And the Holy Lamb having his Hands bound, could not wipe off the Streams of Blood that trickl'd over his Eyes; and so those Two Lights of Heaven were eclips'd, almost blinded, and raw. In fine, such was his Aspect, that he look'd not like himself, nay, scarcely look'd like a Man; but rather like a Picture of Pains and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, drawn by those cruel Painters, and that wicked Judge; to the end this Dismal Sight might move his Enemies to Compassion.</p>

BEsides those Affronts we have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, they added another, which perhaps was the greatest of all that were offer'd our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour throughout the whole Course of his Passion. For it being a Custom of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Pardon some Condemn'd Person, in Honour of the <hi>Passover;</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> being desirous to deliver our Lord from
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:154273:161"/> Death, he propos'd to the Multitude, together with him, one of the worst of Men, to wit, <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who had caus'd a Mutiny in the City, and Kill'd a Man; thinking, that rather than spare that Notorious Malefactor, they would dismiss our Saviour. For the Opposite being so unworthy to live, the Judge conceiv'd they could not be so Blind and Infatuate, as to esteem that Mutineer more worthy of Life, than a Person so Meek. Thus <hi>Pilate</hi> thought to have Deliver'd the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Here you may perceive how far the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Lord extended; since he would submit to stand in Competition with <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and have it put to their Vote, which they thought to be the Better Man, and which of them they deem'd most worthy of Death. But this is not all, for both being propos'd, our Lord was Condemn'd, and <hi>Barabbas</hi> Acquitted. Who will not stand Astonish'd at this Humility and Abjection of the Son of God? Here he seems to have stoop'd lower, than even on the Cross: For on the Cross he was Condemn'd as a Malefactor, and Crucifi'd with Malefactors, as one of them; but here being compar'd with this Criminal, by the unanimous Vote of the Multitude, he is judg'd to be worse than he. O King of Glory, how low has thy Humility brought thee, my Lord! How far did thy Patience, how far did thy Charity extend? Tell me then, vain Man, how great dost thou imagin was the Pride, which could not be Cur'd but by such wonderful Humility, and yet thine is not Cur'd? Tell me also, what Account ought you to make of the Opinions and Judgment of this World; since they Err'd so monstrously, and gave such Judgment in this Cause? And not only in this, but in that of the Prophets, Apostles, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:154273:162"/> Martyrs, whom it so wrongfully Condemn'd? For if thou find thy Servant in only one Lie, thou scarce believ'st a Word he says, as suspecting he may be false as well in one thing as another. Now by the same Rule, what Credit can we give the World, whom we have found in as many Lies, as it has Condemn'd Saints? But particularly, having taken it in this most horrid and impudent Falshood, of accounting the Son of God worse than <hi>Barabbas?</hi> This might suffice to make us stop our Ears, and shut our Eyes, against all the Sayings and Actions of this many-headed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which is so Wild, so Extravagant, and so Barbarous, in all its Opinions and Judgments.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL this nothing availing, at last Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death pass'd upon the Innocent. The more to increase his Sufferings, his Enemies order'd, that he himself should carry on his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Cross whereon he was to Suffer. Those Barbarous Executioners laid hold of the Holy Cross, (which, as it is written, was 15 Foot long) and laid it upon our Saviour's Shoulders; who (considering his Suffering that Day and the Night before, and the Blood he had shed) could scarce stand, or support his Body, and yet they add the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Cross. This was another sort of never-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Cruelty, never before practis'd in the World.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:154273:162"/> For it is usual, when a Man is to Suffer, to hide from him the Instruments of Death; for this Reason, they cover the Eyes of a Man that is to be Beheaded, that he may not see the Ax that is to strike him: But here such Cruelty was us'd with that most Innocent Lamb, that they do not hide Cross from him, but make him carry it on his Shoulders; that his Soul might Suffer with the Sight of the Cross, and his Body be punish'd with the Weight of it; and so he might doubly suffer the Cross, before he was Crucifi'd on it. We do not read that the like was done with the two Thieves who were to suffer with him: Because tho' they were to die on the Cross, they did not oblige them to carry the Cross, as they did our Saviour; intimating hereby, that as his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was more cruel, so his Guilt was greater. What could be more injurious, or more to be lamented than this? O that it were in my power, Sweet Jesus, to have Assisted in that Painful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession! Thou hast Watch'd all Night, and the Bloody Executioners have endeavour'd to out-do one another, in Buffeting and Tormenting thee: And now, after so tedious a Suffering, after being spent and weakned with so much Effusion of Blood, and so many Stripes, they lay the heavy Cross on thy most tender Shoulders, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee to the Place of Execution! O tender Body, what heavy Burden is that thou carriest? Whither dost thou Travel, my Lord, with that Load? What mean those Tokens of Sorrow? Whence comes it, thou thy self should'st carry the Instruments of thy Passion? Behold then, O my Soul, our Lord in this Posture; behold the heavy Burden he carries, and believe thou art part of that Burden, being laid upon it with all the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:154273:163"/> Weight of thy Sins, every one of which weigh<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> more than all the World; and give Thanks to thi<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Good Shepherd, who thus carries the Lost Sheep upon his Shoulders, to restore it to the Flock.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Devout and Spiritual Persons consider usually in this Sorrowful Procession, how our Lord being under so heavy a Load, doubtless fell upon his Knees by the Way. For, tho' the Evangelists do not mention it, yet is it very likely he did so; for our Lord was then so weak, by reason of the many Blows he had endur'd, as well as the Blood he had shed, by the violent Pains caus'd by the Crown of Thorns, and the Hardship of the Night he pass'd among those Cruel Butchers, by the Weight of the Cross he carry'd, and the Haste the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude press'd on with; especially considering, he would not receive any Assistance from his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that so he might lye expos'd to suffer all the Cruelty and Inhumanity of his Enemies would lay on him. Now what could be more dismal, than to see the Saviour of the VVorld fall to the Ground, under that heavy Load which he carry'd on his most tender Shoulders? Then what Heart can be so hard as not break with Sorrow, seeing our Lord thus Kneeling, Prostrate, and VVeakned; especially considering, that at the same time the Burden of our Sins lay heavier on him, than that of the Cross.</p>
               <p n="3">3. VVe have another no less Sorrowful Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to behold in this same Passage, which is the Meeting and Sight of his most Holy Mother by the VVay; for to this Day there is a particular Station shown at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where it hapned. Now what Tongue can express the profound Sorrow of our Blessed Lord, when he saw his Holy Mother, and understood how bitter Grief
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:154273:163"/> at that time pierc'd her tender Heart? For most certainly he lov'd her as a true Son does a true Mother, and such a Mother, and that with a Love not to be parallell d.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides, what Anguish do we believe pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest the Heart of the Blessed Virgin, when she saw the most Innocent Lamb amidst those Cruel Wolves, with that Crown on his Head, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Load on his Shoulders, and his Face so chang d and alter'd, as well expressing the multitude of his Sufferings; but above all, when she saw him led to suffer Death on the Cross?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider how she call'd to mind there the Old Prophecies of Holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> and how she there saw fulfill'd all the Sorrows the Good Old Man had foretold. Where are now, O Blessed Virgin, those mighty Promises of the Angel, who said to thee, <hi>He shall be great,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 1.32.</note>
                  <hi>and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his Father</hi> David. <hi>And he shall reign over the House of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever?</hi> Where is now this Kingdom? Where is the Crown? Where is the Throne of <hi>David?</hi> By this those who hope in the Lord may learn, with how much Patience and Longanimity they are to expect the Accomplishment of his Promises, remembring what the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> says, <hi>He that believes, let him not be hasty.</hi> For by this Example, as well as many others, we may perceive, that our Lord many times puts off the fulfilling of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which delay makes many despond. Thus we see he delay'd many Days the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> which he had promis'd him, letting him first run through many Sufferings. So also he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd making known the Magnificence of the Kingdom of Christ, the true King and Lord of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:154273:164"/> the House of <hi>David,</hi> which is no other than the Church prefigur'd in that same Kingdom of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Wherefore the Prophet warns us, saying, <hi>He shall appear in the end, and his Word shall not fail. And if thou think he stays long, nevertheless hope on; for at length he will come, and will not be long away.</hi> The Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> advises us to this Patience; because our Confidence will fail, unless grounded upon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do thou then, O my Soul, accompany our Lord, together with the Blessed Virgin, in this Sorrowful Procession, hearken to the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made against him, help him to carry the Cross in Compassion to his Sufferings, join thy Tears to those of the Disconsolate Women, who bewail him, and by this judge what will be done in the dry Wood, since these things are done in the green. Accompany also the Blessed Virgin, and the Beloved Disciple, to the place where the Cross was fixt on <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> and weigh the best thou canst, the Excess of their Sorrow at this moving Sight. For if our Lord was in such a Condition, that he broke the Hearts of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that did not know him, nor had any relation to him, what must we imagine, did she feel, who was his Mother, and who lov'd him with so unparallell'd an Affection? Hence thou may'st ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how God treats his dearest Friends in this Life; and that those, who would be such, are to undergo these Laws of Friendship, which all those underwent who truly lov'd him.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Crucifying of our Saviour: Being the Fifth Sorrowful Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. OUR Saviour being come to <hi>Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> was there stripped of his Garments, which were clung to the Sores caus'd by the Stripes he had receiv'd. When they came to take off his Cloaths, it is most likely that those cruel Officers did it after an Inhuman manner, which torn up all the former Sores, and made the Blood gush out anew. What can we imagine our Lord did, seeing himself thus Naked, and his Skin torn off? It is to be believ'd he then lifted up his Eyes to his Father, and gave him Thanks for that he was reduc'd to that Misery, Disgrac'd, and Naked, for the Love of him. Being in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they command him to lye down upon the Cross, which lay on the Ground, and he like a Lamb obeys their Command, stretches himself on that Bed the World had provided for him, and freely gives up his Hands and Feet to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners to be pierc'd. What Thoughts can we think possest the Heart of our Saviour, when he was thus extended on the Cross, and his Eyes fix'd upon Heaven? What can we imagine he said at this time? It is likely he directed his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to his Eternal Father, and said, O Eternal Father, I give thee Thanks for all thou hast wrought in me during the whole Course of my past Life. Now having finish'd my appointed Days in thy Service, I return to thee, but by no other way than that of the Cross. Thou ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst that I should suffer this sort of Death for the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:154273:165"/> Redemption of Man, and I come to fulfil thy Command, and offer up my Life as a Sacrifice to thy Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Saviour being laid on that Cruel Bed, one of those wicked Executioners came with a large Nail, and fixing the point upon the Holy Palm of our Lord's Hand, began with the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to drive the Nail, and make way through the tender Flesh for the hard Iron. The Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hearing those Strokes, every one of them reach'd her Heart; but it is to be admir'd she could see this dismal Sight and live. This very Nail pierc'd her Heart, and rent her Bowels. The violence of the Pain caus'd by this Wound, made all the Nerves and Sinews of the Body to shrink up towards the Hand that was nail'd, and drew the Body after them. Our Merciful Jesus being thus inclin'd to one side, the Bloody But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher laid hold of his other Hand; and to make it reach to the Hole that was bor'd in the opposite Ear of the Cross, he stretched it out so violently, that all the Bones of our Lord's Breast were drawn from their places, and remained so visible and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, that (as the Prophet says) they might be counted. The same sort of Inhumanity, (it may be believed) they used in nailing his Holy Feet, and thus his Sacred Body remained fixed to the Cross.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Pains our Saviour endur'd by his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, were the greatest of all his Passion; for this sort of Death on the Cross, was one of the cruellest and most painful Punishments that were us'd at that time. The reason is, because the Wounds are in the Hands and Feet, where there are more Bones and Sinews meet than in any other part of the Body; and the Nerves and Sinews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:154273:165"/> the Instruments of Feeling, the Wounds in such Parts are consequently the more grievous and painful. Besides, this is not a speedy sort of Death, as others are, but lingring and tedious; so that it does not only Kill, but Wracks him that undergoes it. Now during all this time, the Body which hangs by the Nails, naturally sinks downward, and so rends the Wounds, and tears the Nerves, and continually increases the Pains.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And tho' this Torture were so great, that it might move Compassion to see even a Brute Beast undergo it, yet such was the Savage Malice of our Saviour's Enemies, that they stood by Shaking their Heads, Rejoicing, Jesting and Scoffing at him. And what was this, but to Exulcerate those fresh Wounds, and to Crucifie him with their Tongues, whom before they had fastned to the Cross with Nails.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But yet our Saviour's Sufferings did not stop here; for neither the Zeal of his Charity, nor the Rage of his Enemies, were so satisfied. Therefore they added to all the rest another new, and till then, unheard-of Cruelty. For our Lord being bloodless, his very Bowels dried up, and his Veins drein'd, he being naturally afflicted with most exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Thirst; and uttering that sad Word, <hi>Sitio,</hi> that is, <hi>I Thirst,</hi> those wicked Barbarians were so Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that at such a time they dipt a Spunge in Vinegar for him to Drink. Now what greater Cruelty could be, than to give such Drink to one in that Condition, and to deny a Glass of Water to a dying Man? This proves, that our Lord would have no Part of him to escape without its particular Torture; and therefore would have the Tongue suffer its peculiar Pain, since all his other Members had suffer'd theirs. If then the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:154273:166"/> Lord of the Creation was reduc'd to such Wants and Hardships, for our Redemption; how can a Christian thus Redeem'd, Taught by this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Oblig'd by this mighty Benefit, place his Happiness in the Delights and Pleasures of the Flesh? And how can he but Rejoice, to Suffer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Imitation of Christ, and for his Honour?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Here it is proper to Observe, That tho' the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Lord was so Bitter and Painful, as has been show'd, yet it was no less Reproachful than Painful; that his Life and Reputation might suffer equally. For the Manner of his Death was most Shameful, as being on a Cross, which in those Times was the Punishment of Thieves: The Place was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, being noted for the common Execution of Notorious Malefactors; the Company was so, being Thieves and Wicked Men: And besides, the Day was Remarkable, being the Eve of the <hi>Passover;</hi> for which cause, a multitude of People had resorted to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> from all Parts. And to his greater Shame and Confusion, he was put upon the Cross Naked, which is a Shameful and Dishonourable thing to all Persons of Worth. By this it appears, That in our Saviour's Passion there concurr'd, extream Poverty, extream Shame, and extream Pain. It was requisite it should be so, because his Holy Passion was to be the Destruction and Death of Self-Love, which is the Root of all Evil, and is divided into Three Pestilential Branches; which are, the Love of Honour, Love of Riches, and Love of Pleasure, which is the Incentive to the others. Against the Love of Honour, stands this extraordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; against the Love of Riches, this extreme Poverty; and against the Love of Pleasure, this excessive Pain. And thus Self-Love, which is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:154273:166"/> the Tree of Death, is Cur'd with the Blessed Fruit of Life, which is a General Medicine against all Diseases; whose Leaves (as St. <hi>John</hi> says) are for the Health of Nations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But now turning our Eyes a while from the Son, let us place them upon his Blessed Mother, who was present at all these Pains and Sufferings. What Sorrow pierc'd thy Heart, most Holy Virgin, who being upon the Place where this Tragedy was Acted, and Drinking so great a Share of this Chalice, didst behold that most Holy Body, which thou did so Chastly Conceive, so Sweetly Nourish, so Often Carry in thy Arms, and Rest on thy Bosom; didst behold it, I say, Torn with Thorns, Dishonour'd with Buffets, Pierc'd with Nails, Lifted up on a Cross, Rent with its own Weight; and lastly, Drench'd with Vinegar and Gall? Thou also beheld'st with thy Spiritual Eyes, that most Holy Soul full of all the Bitterness of the World; sometimes overcome with Sorrow, sometimes with Shame, sometimes opprest with Heaviness, sometimes with Fear, and sometimes sinking under extream Anguish; partly for the violent Pain of his Sufferings, partly for the Sins and Crimes of Men, partly in Compassion to our Miseries, and partly in Compassion to thee, his most Loving Mother, seeing thee a Spectator of all his Sufferings. Here her Blessed Soul was Spiritually Crucifi d with her Son, here she was Pierc'd with a most Profound Sorrow, and here she Swallow'd the Vinegar and Gall which he Drank. Here she saw the Prophecies which the Holy <hi>Simeon</hi> had made to her, fulfilled; as well those concerning the Persecutions of the Son, as the extream Grief of the Mother. Here she beheld the Immensity of God's Goodness, the Greatness of his Justice,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:154273:167"/> the Malice of Sin, the Price of the World, and the Value he puts upon Sufferings patiently born, since he so bountifully distributes them to such near Friends.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the next place, thou may'st consider upon those Seven Words which our Saviour spoke upon the Cross; for the Words of Dying Men are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much taken notice of, and remembred; especially when the Person departing is a Father, a Friend, or some other noted Man. And since the wisest of Wise Men, the truest of Friends, and best of Fathers, spoke Seven Words at his Death; it is but reasonable, that we who are his Spiritual Children should always keep them in Mind, and Study them as long as we live. Consider with how Great Charity in these Words he Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Enemies to his Father, with how much Mercy he receiv'd the Thief who Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd him; with what Affection he Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Mother to his Beloved Disciple; how ardently he express'd his Desire of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; with how Doleful a Voice he pour'd out his Prayer, and express'd his Affection to the Divine Majesty; with how Perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, even unto the end, he submitted to his Eternal Father; and how in the last place, he Recommended his Spirit to him, and wholly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd himself up to him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus it appears, that in every one of these Words is contain'd a singular Document of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For in the First, there was Recommended to us Charity towards our Enemies; in the Second, Mercy towards Sinners; in the Third, Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Parents; in the Fourth, the Desire of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind; in the Fifth, Prayer in time of Affliction; in the Sixth, the Virtue of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:154273:167"/> and Perseverance; and in the Seventh, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Resignation to God, which is the Top of all our Perfection.</p>
               <p n="10">10. With this last Word our Saviour ended at once his Life, the Work of our Redemption, and the Obedience which he had in Charge, like a true Son of Obedience; letting fall his Head, turning it away from the Honourable Inscription that was upon the Cross, and recommending his Spirit to his Eternal Father. Then the Vail of the Temple was suddenly rent, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks split asunder, and the Graves open'd. Then the most Beautiful of Men, having his Eyes sunk, and his Face cover'd with a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wanness, remain'd the most Miserable Spectacle among them; being made an Offering of most sweet Odour for them, to appease the Anger of his Father, which they had incurr'd. Look down then, most Holy Father, from thy Heavenly Mansion, upon thy Christ, behold this most Pure Sacrifice which this High-Priest Offers up for our Sins. And do thou also, O Man, who hast been Redeem'd, consider Who, and how Great he is, that hangs on the Cross; whose Death raises the Dead; whose Departure the Heavens bewail, whose Suffering the very Rocks, and all the Elements are sensible of. Thou then, O Human Heart, art harder than all these things, if beholding this Spectacle, thou art not Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Fear, not Mov'd to Compassion, nor Melted to Pity.</p>

AND, as if all these Tortures had not been enough for the body whilst Living, they vented their Rage upon it after it was Dead; therefore after our Lord had Expir'd, one of the Souldiers pierc'd his Side with a Spear, whence issu'd Blood and Water, to Wash and Baptize the World. Arise then, thou Spouse of Christ, and build here thy Nest, like the Dove in the Holes of the Rock; like a Bird, build here thy Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and like a a chaste Turtle, hide here thy Young Ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law God ordain'd, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cities should be appointed in the Land of Promise, to be Places of Refuge for Malefactors: But in the Law of Grace, the Places of Refuge for Sinners, are these most Precious Wounds of Christ; where they are shelter'd from all Dangers, and from all the Persecutions of this World. But above all, the Wound of his Side, prefigured by the Door on the Side of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, at which all Creatures enter'd to escape the Waters of the Deluge, is most suitable for this Purpose. Fly then, all ye that are Afflicted, and in Tribulation, amidst the troubl'd and bitter Waves of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous World: All ye that desire true Peace and Tranquility, fly to this Harbour, enter into this Ark of Security, and enter at the Door that is open'd in this most Holy Side. Let this be your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, your Habitation, your Paradice, and your Temple, where you may rest for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:154273:168"/>3. In the next place it remains to consider, with how much Compassion and Devotion those Holy Men unnailed and took down from the Cross that most Sacred Body, with what Sorrow and Floods of Tears the most Disconsolate Mother receiv'd it into her Arms; and what Grief pierc'd the Hearts of the Beloved Disciple, St. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and the other Holy Women; how they wrap'd it in the new Sheet, how they cover'd the Face with a Linnen Cloth; and lastly, how they carry'd and laid it in the Sepulcher that was in the Garden. In a Garden the Passion of Christ began, and in a Garden it ended; and thus our Saviour Redeem'd us from the Sin committed in the Garden of Paradice, and thus he leads us to the Garden of Heaven. Grant me then, Sweet Jesus, tho' I be unworthy, that since I could not then be present with thy Body at those Sorrowful Obsequies, I may be present by Meditating on them, by revolving them in my Heart with Faith and Love; and by feeling in me some part of that piercing Grief and Compassion, which thy most Innocent Mother and the Holy <hi>Magdalen</hi> felt upon that Day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is, Dear Christian, a Brief Account of the Holy Passion; these are the Wounds, which the Son of God receiv'd for our sake. Let this then be our Glory, our Refuge, our Subject of Prayer and Mourning all the Days of our Life; as it was to the most Religious and Devout St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who speaking upon this Subject, says, <hi>O Amiable Passion, O Delightful Death! If I were the Wood of that Holy Cross, and the Hands and Feet of my Good</hi> Jesus <hi>had been nail'd upon me, I would say to those Holy Men, who took him down from the Cross, Do not separate me
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:154273:169"/> from my Lord, but Bury me with him, that I may never be parted from him. But what I cannot do with my Body, I will do with my Heart. O how good it is to be with</hi> Jesus <hi>Crucifi'd! I will make Three Dwellings in him; one in his Hands, one in his Feet, and another perpetual one in his Precious Side. Here I will Rest, Repose, Sleep, and Pray. Here I will speak to his Heart, and he will grant me all I shall ask. O Amiable Wounds of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer! As I was entring once into them with my Eyes open, the Blood that gush'd from them took away my Sight; and when I could see nothing but Blood, I entred further, feeling about with my Hands, even to the Bowels of his Charity; in which I found my self so entangled, that I can get out no more from them. In them I dwell, on their Food I am maintain'd; I drink of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Liquor, which is so sweet, that I can neither express, nor comprehend it. Yet I fear to come out of this Delightful Mansion, and to lose the Comfort in which I live: But I firmly hope, that since his Wounds are always open, I shall get in through them again, that my Habitation may be always in him. O blessed Spear, and blessed Nails, that didst open unto us the Way of Life; were I the Point of that Spear, I would desire never to come out of that Divine Breast; but would say, This is my Rest for ever, here I will Dwell, for I have chosen this Dwelling.</hi> Thus far the Words of St. <hi>Bonaventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Behold then here, O my Soul, our Saviour on the Cross; where he Sleeps, where he Rests, and where he Feeds his Kids at Noon-day. Here is the Pasture of Life, here is the Cure of all thy Diseases; here is Instruction for thy Ignorance, here is Satisfaction for thy Sins; and here is the Mirror,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:154273:169"/> wherein thou may'st see all thy Failings. This is the Mirror God order'd to be plac'd in the Temple; in which the Priests should see themselves, before they went in to Minister before him: For here the Devout Soul seeing it self in this Cross, and contemplating on the Virtues and Perfections of him that is Crucifi'd on it, sees all the Faults of its own Life, more plain than in the fairest Glass. O Bright and Beautiful Mirrour of all Virtue! how plainly from the Cross thou discoverest all my Vices and Sins! That Painful Cross condemns my Inordinate Passions and Pleasures, that Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness my Extravagancies and Superfluities, that Crown of Thorns all my Costly Dresses, that Vinegar and Gall my Delicate Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; those Arms extended to receive Friends and Enemies, reproach my Rancour and Malice; that Prayer thou mad'st for thy Enemies, blames the Anger I bear against mine; that Heart open to all, and even to those that pierc'd it, upbraids the Hardness of mine, which is so Deaf to the Wants of my Neighbours; those Eyes full of Tears, and wan for my Sins, correct the Vanity and Loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mine; and those Ears, which so patiently heard so many Reproaches, discover the greatness of my Impatience, which is mov'd even at a Straw. So that from Head to Foot, thou art to me a Mirrour of Perfection, and a singular Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all Virtue. Here those Four Virtues, of Charity, Patience, Obedience, and Humility, are singularly resplendent. With these Four Precious Stones, wert thou pleas'd, O Lord, to adorn the Four Extremities of the Cross; of them (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) <hi>Charity is at the Top, Humility</hi> (the Foundation of Virtue) <hi>at the Bottom, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on the Right Hand, and Patience on the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:154273:170"/> Left.</hi> With these Four Jewels didst thou Enrich this Glorious Standard, shewing thy Self on it so Patient in Sufferings, so Humble amidst Affronts, so Loving towards Men, and so Obedient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Here then, O my Soul, thou hast Matter of Instruction, of Correction, and of Comfort; for all these Effects are to be found in the Virtues and Wounds of Christ. They Teach the Diligent, Correct the Negligent, Heal the Sick, and Strengthen the Weak and Desponding. Let his Obedience then, O Eternal Father, make Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for my Disobedience, his Humility for my Pride, his Patience for my Impatience, his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality for my Avarice, and his Hardships and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for my Softness and Pleasures. I offer thee his Precious and Undeserved Death, for the Death I have deserv'd; his Pains, for the Pains I merit; and his full Satisfaction, for all the Debts of my Sins; for he abundandtly makes Amends for all that is wanting in me. And since thou dost not absolutely, O Lord, Punish the same Crime twice; being thou hast punish'd my Sins in him, do not punish them again eternally in me; but give me thy Grace, that I may bewail and punish them by Suffering in this Life; and so doing, may obtain to Reign with him for ever in his Glory.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Combat of the Passion being over, when the Infernal Fiend thought he had
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:154273:170"/> gain'd the Victory over the Lamb, even then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Divine Omnipotency to appear in his Soul; by Virtue whereof, our Invincible Lion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into Hell, and having Conquer'd and Secur'd his Powerful Opposite Satan, took from him the Rich Booty the Tyrant held in Captivity: To the end, that since the Usurper had aim d at the Head, to which he had no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension, he might justly forfeit the Title he thought he had to the Members. Then the true <hi>Sampson</hi> Dying, Slew his Enemies; then the Unspotted Lamb, with the Blood of his Testament, Drew his Prisoners out of the Lake where there was no Water: then the true <hi>David,</hi> with the Sword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> Cut off the Head of <hi>Goliah,</hi> when our Saviour by Death overthrew the Author of Death; who by Means of it, carry'd all Men Captives to his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having obtain'd this Glorious Victory, on the Third Day the Author of Life, after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Death, arose from the Dead; and so the true <hi>Joseph</hi> came out of the Prison of Hell, by Command of the Supream King; after Cutting off the Hair of Mortality and Weakness, and being Cloathed in Immortality and Beauty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here thou may'st consider the Joy that was this Day in all the several Apartments; to wit, the Joy of the Fathers who were in <hi>Limbo,</hi> whom our Saviour first Visited, and Deliver'd out of Captivity; the Joy of the most Blessed Virgin; the Joy of those Holy Women who went to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher to Anoint him; and the Joy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, who had been so Disconsolate without their Master, and found such Comfort in seeing him Risen from the Dead.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:154273:171"/>4. Consider then in the first place, how great was the Joy of those Holy Fathers detain'd there till this Day, when they saw their Deliverer; and what Praises and Thanks they rendred him, for their so-long-wish'd-for Liberty. Those who return from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> say, they account all the Labours and Hardships of that long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as a Pleasure, because of the great Joy it is to them to return to their Native Country. Now if the Joy be so great after a Voyage of Two or Three Years, what must we imagine it to be, after a Banishment of Three or Four Thousand, to Arrive at the Port, and be Restor'd to the Land of the Living.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then who can express the Joy the Blessed Virgin conceiv'd this Day, at the sight of her Son risen from the Dead? For as she endur'd the greatest Sorrow for his Sufferings, so she was sensible of the greatest Joy at his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then in what a Rapture was this Holy Virgin, when she saw her Son Alive, Glorifi'd and Accompany'd by those Holy Fathers who were Risen with him; what Kisses, what Embraces did she bestow on him? What abundance of Tears flow'd from her Eyes? What Passionate Desires had she to follow him, if it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her?</p>
               <p n="6">6. What shall I say of the Joy of the other Holy <hi>Maries,</hi> and particularly, of her who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd Weeping at the Sepulcher, when she fell down at the Feet of our Lord, and saw him in so Glorious a Posture? And observe here, that next to his Mother, he first appear'd to her who Lov'd most, Persever'd most, Wept most, and Sought him with most Diligence; that thou may'st be assur'd thou shalt find God, if thou thus seekest him with Tears and Solicitude.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:154273:171"/>7. In the next place consider the Weakness of the Apostles, who so soon dismay'd and fell from the Faith, seeing the Scandal of the Passion; and from hence gather how Miserable our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and how easily we despond, and are led away, tho' we were never so well assur'd and resolv'd. On the other hand, observe the Fatherly Goodness and Providence of our Lord, who forsakes not his People for any long time, but soon succours and comforts them with his Presence. He well knows our Weakness, he is sensible of what Mould we are made, and therefore suffers us not to be Tempted above our Strength. Five times he Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to them on the Day of his Resurrection; and the Three Days of being in the Sepulcher, he shortned to Forty Hours, reck'ning from the time he Expir'd on the Cross, which is not Two Days compleat; and in lieu of these Forty Hours of Sadness, he gave them Forty Days of Joy: That thou may'st see how Merciful this Lord is to his People; and how much more free he is in giving them Consolation, than Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Consider also how he Appear'd to the two Disciples that were going to <hi>Emaus;</hi> observe how Affable he was with them, how Familiarly he bore them Company, how Sweetly he Conceal'd himself from them; and lastly, how Lovingly he Discover'd himself to them, leaving them full of Sweetness and Joy. Let thy Discourses be such as pass'd betwixt these Two; talk with Sorrow and Feeling of what they talk'd; that is, of the Pains and Sufferings of Christ's Passion; and be assur'd, thou shalt not fail of his Presence and Company, no more than they did.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's Ascending into Heaven: Being the Second Mystery of the most Holy <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AT the end of Forty Days, our Saviour carry'd his Disciples out of the City to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and there sweetly taking Leave of them, and of his Holy Mother; lifting his Hands on high, whilst they look'd on, he Ascended to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Bright Cloud; taking with him the Prisoners he had releas'd, to make them Citizens of Heaven, and Domesticks in the House of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what Tongue can here express, with what Glory, what Joy, what Acclamations, and what Praises, that Glorious Conqueror was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Celestial City? What Reception was made for him? What a Sight it was, to see Men and Angels there join'd, and mounting to Heaven, to fill those Seats which had so long stood empty; and to see that most Holy Humanity Ascend above them all, and Seat it self on the Right Hand of the Father? All this is worthy our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may in it see how profitable Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are, when endur'd for the Love of God; and how he who Humbl'd himself, and Suffer'd more than all Creatures, is here made Great, and Exalted above them all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this most Glorious Mystery, thou may'st consider in the first place, how our Lord put off his Ascension for the space of Forty Days, both to Confirm his Disciples in the Faith and Hope of Resurrection; and also to use them by
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:154273:172"/> degrees to live without him, and to endure the want of his most pleasing Company; which if they had been suddenly depriv'd of, it must have been to them a great Trouble and Affliction. Therefore as a Mother by little and little Weans her Child, and not all at once, because these sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Changes are not agreeable to Nature; so neither was it proper, that all at once the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should be depriv'd of the most sweet Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ's Company and Conversation; but that he should entertain them till the Coming of the Holy Ghost, who was wholly to VVean them, to teach them to Stand alone, and enure them to Hardships. Here is a wonderful Proof of the Providence of our Lord, and of the several sorts of Usage he has for his Children, according to the Times; how he Cherishes the VVeak, and Tries the Strong; gives Milk to the Little Ones, and VVeans the Great Ones; Comforts some, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes others; and so Treats every one, as is best for them. Thus it follows, that neither he that is Cherish'd has cause to be Puff'd up, since that Cherishing is a sign of VVeakness; nor he who is Rebuk'd to Dismay, because it is often a token of Strength.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Forty Days being expir'd he Ascended into Heaven, in the presence and sight of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, because they were to be the VVitnesses of these Mysteries; and none is so good a Witness of the Works of God, as he that knows them by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. If thou wilt truly know how Good, and how Sweet, how Pleasing God is to his Children, and how Efficacious is his Grace, his Love, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations; ask it of them who have try'd it, and they will give thee sufficient Proofs thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:154273:173"/>5. He would also have them see him Ascend into Heaven; to the end they might follow him with their Eyes, and in Spirit; that they might be more sensible of his Departure, and be the more Lonesom in his Absence; because this was the most proper Preparative for the receiving of his Grace. <hi>Eliseus</hi> ask'd his Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Good Master answered, <hi>If thou see me when I shall be taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked.</hi> Now according to this, those shall be Heirs of the Spirit of Christ, whom Love makes concern'd at his Absence; and who in this Banishment always Sigh after his Presence. For the Holy Ghost loves the Lovers of Christ, and loves them so, that he requires of them no fitter Preparation to receive his Grace, than this Love. So he did with that Holy Sinner, of whom it was said, <hi>Many Sins are forgiven her, because she has Loved much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. How can we conceive the Solitude, the Tears, and the Sorrow of the Blessed Virgin, of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Disciple, of the Holy <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and of all the Apostles, when they saw him vanish from their Eyes, to whom they had so absolutely given up their Hearts? This is not to be exprest with any Words. Yet it is said, they return'd to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> with great Joy, by reason of the great Love they bore him: For the same Love which made them so Sensible of his Absence, on the other hand made them much more Rejoice at his Glory; because true Love seeks not it Self but the Object Belov'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But do not think, that because our Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself from Men, and is now Reigning in Heaven, therefore he forgets the Children he left in this World; for as he Assisted us here with his Sufferings, so there he Assists us with his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:154273:173"/> Intercession, performing on Earth the Office of a Redeemer, and in Heaven that of an Advocate. For it was convenient we should have such a High-Priest; to wit, one that was Holy, Innocent, Pure, Remote from Sin, and Lifted up above the Heavens; who being Seated on the Right Hand of Majesty, there presents the Marks of his Wounds to the Eternal Father for us; from thence Governing the Mystical Body of his Church, and Distributing several Benefits to Men, in order to incorporate and make them like himself. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he (who is our Head) was afflicted, and suffered many Tribulations in this World, so he requires his Body should be, that there may be no Deformity or Disproportion betwixt the Head and the Members. For it were very disagreeable and dissonant, that when the Head is tormented, the Members should be cherish'd; that when the Head is so humbl'd, they should desire to be worship'd; and that when the Head has not a place to rest upon, they should desire to be Lords of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. For this Reason, the Divine Wisdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that all the Saints who ever were in the Church since the Beginning of the World, should be Try'd and Exercis'd by several sorts of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. The Patriarchs, the Prophets, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the Martyrs, the Confessors, the Virgins, and the Religious Men, were all at several times Prov'd and Examin'd, by many and great Afflictions. Through this same Fiery Trial also must all the other Living Members of Christ pass till the Day of Judgment, he ordaining it so from above; to the end they may afterwards sing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, saying, <hi>We have passed through Fire and Water, and thou hast brought us, O Lord, to rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:154273:174"/>8. Thus our High-Priest being Seated on that Throne, Governs all this Mystical Body of his Church. All Tongues render thee Praises, O Eternal Father, for this great Benefit, wherein thou gavest us thy only Begotten Son; that on the one hand he might be our Governour, and on the other our Advocate; for so great were our Sins, and so many our Miseries, that none but He was able to Redress them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XL.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of our Saviour's coming to Judgment.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AFter the Ascending into Heaven, that very Hour the Angels testifi'd, that our Lord should return again in the same manner to Judge the World, as he had ascended into Heaven: Thus warning us, so to think on the Mercy of his First Coming, as not to forget the Severity and Justice of the Second; to the end this Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance might be a Curb and Check upon our Life. How Terrible this Judgment will be, is not to be express'd. For God has shown many other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World; as when he Destroy'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with the Waters of the Deluge, when he Burnt <hi>Sodom</hi> and the neighbouring Cities, when he Punish'd <hi>Egypt</hi> with several Plagues, when he opened the Earth in the Desart, to swallow up Sinners; but all these, compar'd to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Last Day, are but like Shadows to the Substance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the better comprehending some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Terror of this Day, consider first the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:154273:174"/> astonishing Signs that will precede it, which will appear in the Sun, Moon, Stars, Sea, and Earth. Therefore the Evangelist says, Men will stand astonish'd, and be terrifi'd to Death with the fear of the Evils that shall befall the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider the Sound of that terrible Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet that shall be heard throughout all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the World, and the astonishing Voice of the Archangel, saying, <hi>Arise ye Dead, and come to Judgment.</hi> Consider how astonishing it will be to see the Dead rise, some from the Sea, and some from the Land, with the same Bodies wherein they liv'd in this World, to receive in them the good or evil they did: And think what a wonder it will be, that the Bodies of the Dead, being some turn'd to Clay, others to Ashes, some eaten by Fish, and others by Men, yet God, after so many years, will separate what belongs to every one, without confounding them together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now what a Terror will it be to see the whole World in a flame, to see Structures fall, the Earth shake, the Elements disorder'd, the Sun, Moon and Stars become dark, all Creatures die, the Sepulchres open; to hear the sound of the Trumpet, to see Men tremble, Consciences laid open, the frightful shapes of Devils, and the smoke of the Infernal Fire? But above all, it will be terrible to see the Royal Standard of the Cross set up in the Air, with all the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the Passion; and to behold our Lord laying to his Enemies Charge, all the Pains he endur'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider also the coming of the Judge, and the fright of the Wicked, seeing him come in such Glory, for then they will call to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall on them, and to the Hills to cover
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:154273:175"/> them, that they may not appear before him. Consider how all Mankind will be there Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the Meek and Humble being plac'd on the Right Hand, and the Proud and Obstinate on the Left; and what Confusion it will be to the Great Ones of the Earth, when they shall there behold the Poor and Humble, whom they despis'd, so highly Exalted and Extoll'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider how strict an Account will be there taken, since it appears by the Gospel, that we are there to answer for every idle Word. If thou wouldst conceive the severity of this Judgment, in the first place look upon the Terror of Christ the Judge, whose Countenance will shew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Revenge, as at his first coming he shew'd nothing but Meekness. From him, as being the Supreme Judge, there lyes no Appeal, there is no flying from him, as he is all Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nothing can be hid from him, because he is the God of Knowledge, and he will leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unpunish'd, because Sin is most hateful to him. Then wilt thou be forc'd to answer to many things, the most inconsiderable of which will cause thee much trouble. Who can pay so many Debts, as will be there demanded. There thou wilt be ask'd, how thou hast spent thy Time, how thou hast us'd thy Body, how thou hast recollected thy Sences, how thou hast guarded thy Heart, how thou hast answer'd Divine Inspirations, how thou hast acknowledg'd and made use of so many Benefits. To every Accusation there will be as many Witnesses, as there are Creatures, thou hast made ill use of, which at that time will so Confound thee, that if it were possible, even those that are Immortal would then Die for fear. What a terrible thing
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:154273:175"/> then will it be for a wicked Man to see himself there beset on all sides with Anguish, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he turns his Eyes, he will meet something to dread. The angry Judge will be above, Hell gaping below, the Sins that accuse him on the Right Hand, the Devils ready to carry him away into Torments on the Left; without him will be the World in a Flame, and within him will be the Sting of Conscience. Whither then can a wicked Man fly, being surrounded with such Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? It is impossible to hide himself, and intolerable to appear; for if the Just Man shall scarce be sav'd, what then will become of the Wicked and Sinful Man?</p>

Hence you may gather the Value of the Works of Mercy, and the Joy and Contentment he will there Conceive, who was here Merciful towards his Neighbours, for there God will be so towards him; and on the contrary, Torments will receive those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not give what they left behind in this World, shall be there banish'd Heaven.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Pains of Hell.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FROM this Judgment the Just shall go to Everlasting Life, and the Wicked to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:154273:176"/> Fire. Now for the better understanding of this Punishment, thou must guess at the Place of Hell by some Similes the Saints have given us. Imagine then that Hell is a horrid Darkness, an abominable Dungeon under the Earth, and a deep Well full of flames of Fire. Imagine also, that it is a hideous dark City, whose Inhabitants Day and Night confound one another with Outcries and Despair, through the Violence and Rage of the Pains they endure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Think then on the bitterness of the Pains that are there endur'd, on the multiplicity and durableness of them. As to their vehemency, think how great must be the Torment of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Fire, which will be always Burning and Consuming, without ever ceasing to Torment and Consume. The same is to be understood of the insufferable Cold, and the Stink there is in that detestable Place. The bitterness of these Pains is express'd by the Gnashing of Teeth, the Groans and Lamentations, the Blasphemies and Curses, which the Scripture tells us there is there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Think on the Multiplicity of Pains. For there is Fire which cannot be quenched, Cold that cannot be born, horrible Stink, Darkness that may be felt like that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and much more. There all the Sences shall suffer their peculiar Torture. The Eyes shall be punish'd with the horrible sight of the Devils. The Ears with the dismal Groans and Cries of that Miserable Company, and of those Cruel Tormentors, who neither grow weary of Tormenting, or know what Compassion is, and who shall Scoff at the Wicked, saying, <hi>Where is now the Glory and Pride of your Titles? Where the Crouds of Servants and Sycophants that attended you?</hi> So also shall the Taste and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:154273:176"/> suffer, and all our Members which help'd us to Sin, every one suitable to its Guilt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next to the Exterior Pains of the Body, think on the Inward Sufferings of the Soul, but especially on that Worm which never Dies, that is, the Sting of Conscience, for the past ill Life. But who can rightly conceive, how great will be the Rage and Despair of the Wicked, when they consider with how Light and Transitory Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they might have redeem'd such Lasting and Intolerable Torments? Neither will the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of past Prosperity and Pleasure be a less Punishment to them, which will move them to repeat those Words of the Book of Wisdom: <hi>What hath Pride profited us? Or what Commodity hath the Vaunting of Riches brought us? All those things are passed away as a Shadow, and as a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger running before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. All these Pains are most Excessive, but the Company of the Damned, and the sad and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Darkness that covers them, is no less misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but above all, the grief for having lost God, without the least hope of ever recovering him. This Pain as much exceeds all other sensible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Divine Beauty exceeds all the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Hell.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But above all, consider the continuance of these Pains, which (besides their being so great, so universal, and so incessant, that not one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ease or Intermission is granted) are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have an end; not after a Thousand Years, nor after a Thousand Millions of Millions, nor after as many Years as can be express'd in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for there will be no term of Time, no End, no Redemption, no Escape, no Year of Jubilee, no place for Repentance, nor remission of Sins,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:154273:177"/> but perpetual Sorrow, and Despair, for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. So that if the Damned could hope, that after the whole Ocean were drein'd, by taking out every Thousand, or every Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years, but One Drop of Water, there would be an End, it would be a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him, because, tho' very late, at last this End would come. But they have not even this poor and miserable Comfort. Tell me then, O wretched and distracted Man, if thou think'st it an intolerable Torment to hold thy Hand over a flame of Fire only, whilst one might repeat the <hi>Creed,</hi> and if there be nothing thou wouldst not do to avoid that Pain; how comes it thou dost not do something to escape lying always in this Bed of Fire, which will last for all Eternity?</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Glory of Heaven.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS the Wicked shall be Condemn'd to the Torments of Hell, so on the contrary, the Just shall be Crown'd and Rewarded with the Glory of Heaven. For the better conceiving the greatness of this Glory, thou must also guess at the place where it is, according to the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions Saints give us of it, suitable to our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Comprehension. Imagine then a City all of most pure Gold, wonderfully Built with Precious Stones, and every Gate of it made of one single inestimable Jewel. Imagine a most Beautiful and Spacious Plain, full of all the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Verdures that can be thought of, where there is perpetual Summer, Meadows always
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:154273:177"/> Green, and sending forth unspeakable Fragrancy. Having thus conceiv'd the Place, think first what a Glory it will be, to see that most Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is a most perfect Landskip, wherein appears all the Beauty, all the Greatness, all the Goodness, and all the Sweetness that can be wish'd; in whose Sight alone thou shalt Have all thou canst Desire, and Know all thou canst Aspire to, according to the Proportion of Glory that shall be allotted thee. For this is it that is call'd the Book of Life, whose Original is Eternal, whose Being is Incorruptible, whose Knowledge is Life, whose Doctrine is Easie, whose Learning is Sweet, whose Depth cannot be Fathom'd, whose Writing cannot be Blotted out, and whose Words cannot be Explicated. Think then on the next Glory which follows immediately after this; to wit, the clear Sight of the most Sacred Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, who for our Redemption was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd on the Cross, and for our Glory resides in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for in this we have the Advantage of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in that the common Lord of both is truly Man, and not an Angel, tho' he be all in every thing. Think next, what Joy thy Soul will receive in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any of all the other Saints, who are innumerable: For thou shalt with them Rejoice at their Joys, because the Excess of Charity which there reigns, makes all Happiness common; and therefore what thou hast not in thy self, thou wilt have in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Think likewise on those singular Perfections wherewith the Bodies of the Saints shall be there endow'd, as a Reward for their having faithfully Assisted the Souls to which they belong'd; which are Impassibility, Penetrability, Agility, and Clarity, in such a degree as is not to be express'd. Nor are the Endowments of the Souls less; to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:154273:178"/> wit, fulness of Wisdom in the Understanding, with an utter Banishment of all Ignorance; and fulness of Joy in the Will, without the least mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sorrow; besides other Inestimable Gifts which they shall there receive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. On this Subject a Devout Person may Enlarge as much as he pleases, here he may look yet much further, considering the Excess of this Supream Blessing which is reserv'd for us. How great then is the Debt thou owest to that Lord, who Created and Redeem'd thee for such Incomprehensible Happiness? And who has Expected thee, even to this Time; and always Assists thee with his Grace, for the obtaining of this Crown? O Happy Kingdom, where all the Saints Reign with Christ, whose Law is Truth, whose Peace is Charity, and whose Life is Eternity; which is not divided by the Multitude of those that Reign, nor is lessen'd by the Number of those who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it; nor is disorder'd by the Concourse, nor confounded by Variety, nor confin'd to Room, nor alter'd by Motion, nor chang'd by Time which changes all things, but lasts to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head type="sub">An Introduction, in order to treat of the Knowledge of one's Self.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AT the beginning of this Second Treatise we said, that according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> there were two sorts of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which serv'd to excite Devotion. The
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:154273:178"/> one was, the Consideration of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Benefits, and the other, of our own Sins and Infirmities. Of these, the former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Knowledge of God, and the latter to the Knowledge of our Selves; and therefore the former serve to inflame Charity, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to create Humility: The one roots Man in Virtue, and the other makes him grow and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more perfect in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hitherto we have Treated of the greatest of the Divine Benefits, which is our Redemption, and comprehends the whole Life of our Saviour, a most Fruitful and Excellent Subject for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; of the other Benefits and Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we shall speak in the following Treatise, which is of the Love of God, and to which this Meditation is particularly conducing. It remains now to conclude this Treatise, that we say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Knowledge of our Selves; from which, as has been said, proceeds the Virtue of Humility, which is the Ground of all Virtues, and makes room in our Soul for God, who dwells in the Hearts of the Humble; and banishes thence all Pride and Presumption, which are the Principal Obstacles that hinder Devotion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now for the obtaining of this Virtue, we ought to observe Two Principal Points, that are conducing to it. One is, the Multitude of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Sins Man is subject to; and the other, that he has nothing that is Good of his own, but what comes from God: By the one he will perceive how poor and naked he is, and by the other how infirm and full of weakness. By the one he will plainly discover, that he has nothing to glory in; since as the Apostle says, <hi>What hast thou, that thou hast not received?</hi> And by the other,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:154273:179"/> he will see how much Reason he has to humble and contemn himself, being sensible what Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are in him.</p>

               <head type="sub">The First Part of this Exercise; that is, of our Miseries and Infirmities.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOW as to the First Part of this Exercise, which relates to our Infirmities, and the Evils we are subject to, much may be said upon this Subject, because Man is plentifully stor'd with Evils and Miseries. For as he is compos'd of Body and Soul, so also is he subject to Evils of Body and Soul. Amongst those of the Soul (which are the greatest) there are some common to all Men, which are the Evils of Nature; and some Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to every Person; among which, some respect the Life past, (which we fell into formerly) and others the present, (into which we daily fall). Of all these we shall here Treat in order, tho' briefly; only making the way plain and easie, to such as desire to improve themselves in this Profitable and Christian Learning.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of the Evils of the Body.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. BEginning at the Evils of the Body, thou may'st briefly consider these three Points; to wit, What thou wast before thou wert Born, what thou art after thy Birth, and what thou
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:154273:179"/> shalt be after thy Death. Before thou wert Born, thou wast a filthy and abominable Substance, not fit to be nam'd; whence thou may'st infer what sort of a Structure it is, that is compos'd of such Materials, since no Effect can exceed the Nature of its Cause. After thy Birth, (if thou look upon thy self within and without) thou wilt find, thou art a meer Heap of Dirt cover'd with Snow, a Sepulcher whiten'd on the outside, and within full of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; a Fardle of Miseries and Diseases: and finally, one of the weakest Creatures in the World, subject to more Dangers, Disasters, Misfortunes, Sickness, and Calamities, than there are Sands in the Sea. Here thou may'st extend thy Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Miseries of Human Life; which is short, uncertain, frail, deceitful, changeable and miserable, and more brittle than a Glass. For a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof hereof, I cannot omit to relate, That at the time I was writing this Book, News came to this City, that there was brought to a Town call'd <hi>Azurara</hi> a Chest full of Cloaths, from some Part where the Plague then rag'd; and this thing alone so infected the Air, that when the News came away Eighty Persons were already Dead, Thirty more remain'd in a bad Condition; and it was fear'd lest the whole Kingdom might partake of the Contagion, unless a strict Guard were kept in all Places. Tell me then what Glass, what Earthen Vessel, or what Cobweb can be more weak and brittle than our Life, which is subject to such Dangers, and liable to be so easily cut off? What do they mean, who raise such Airy Castles upon such Weak Foundations? And who extend their Hopes so far, whenas our Lives are so frail and uncertain.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:154273:180"/>3. Now if thou consider what thou shalt be after thou art Dead, go but to a Grave, and fix thy Eyes upon a Body that has been Buried two or three Days, observe its Colour, Smell, Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure, Deformity, and Abominable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and thou wilt perceive what a Body is after it is Dead, and how little Difference there is betwixt it and a Carrion that lyes on a Dunghil full of Worms, Stinking, and so Ghastly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that those who pass by turn away their Eyes, stop their Noses, and make haste to shun the Infection. Crowns and Miters come to this End, and into this all our Glory and Beauty is converted. Those Bodies which but a little while before, when Alive, were Treated with so much Delicacy, Provided for with such Care, Attended with so much Respect, Handled with so much Diligence, Cloath'd so Curiously, and Perfum'd with so many Sweet Odours, and for whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Sea and Land Furnish'd all the Rarities of the East and West, become the most Nauseous, most Horrible, and most Contemptible thing in the World. And as there is no Creature upon Earth more Beautiful or Powerful than a Living Man, so there is nothing more Vile or Deformed than he when Dead.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of the Evils of the Soul. And First, of those which are Common to all Men.</head>
                  <p n="4">4. AS touching the Inward Evils and Miseries of the Soul, thou may'st Range them under these Three Heads; to wit, the Common Evils of Human Nature, which are Proper to all
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:154273:180"/> Men, and those that are peculiar to thy self, in regard to thy past Life, before thou wert called by God; and to the present, if perhaps thou hast been call'd by him. As to the First of these, thou must understand, That no Human Tongue can express to what Poverty, Nakedness, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress Human Nature was reduc'd by Sin; and how indispos'd it is for all that is Good, unless assisted with special Grace of the Holy Ghost. But amongst all these Evils and Miseries, thou may'st particularly observe these Four, which are as it were the Roots and Sources whence the others flow. Of these the First is, our being Conceiv'd in Original Sin;<note place="margin">Psal. 50.6.</note> which is the Misery that <hi>David</hi> urg'd to excuse himself, saying, <hi>For behold I was Conceiv'd in Iniquities, and in Sins hath my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conceiv'd me.</hi> Here he calls Original Sin, Iniquities and Sins; for (as a Divine says) tho' in the act it be but one Sin, yet virtually it is all Sins, because they all spring from this Root; and hence it is that the Practice of Virtue is so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, as Holy <hi>Job</hi> testifies, where he says,<note place="margin">Job 14.4.</note>
                     <hi>Who can make clean him that is conceiv'd of unclean Seed? Is it not thou which only art?</hi> For as the Cloth that was dyed in the Wool, is very hard to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd; so who can overcome the Evil Inclination to Sin, which is grounded in Man, (that is to say, in the very Matter or Substance of Man) unless he be specially assisted by God? If it be so hard to Correct the Deprav'd Habits contracted in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, what will it be to Shake off those which were before, which we brought out of the Womb, and whose Origin is older than Man himself; they being at the very Moment of his Creation moulded with the very Matter whereof he was compos'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:154273:181"/>5. Hence springs another very great Infirmity, which is the Corruption and Decay of all the Faculties and Powers of Man: For as Leaven spreads through all the Mass of Dough, and soures it, if it be suffer'd to lye long in it; and as Poison diffuses it self through all the Limbs of the Body, swells and envenoms them; so the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Poison of Sin dilated it self through all the Faculties of the Soul, and comunicated its Malice to them all. Thus the Understanding (which is the chief of these Faculties) became Dull for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving those things which are of God, the Free Will grew Diseas'd, the Inclination to Good Weak, the Desire of Evil Strong and Ungovernable, the Imagination Restless, the Memory Unsettled, the Senses Curious, and the Flesh Foul, and Ill-dispos'd.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Amidst these Faculties, consider how Wild and Distracted our Imagination became, and how Disobedient to our Reason; for we can scarce say the <hi>Creed</hi> with our Thought wholly fix'd upon God, but that insensibly it will slip away, and wander over all the World. So that there is scarce a Leaf of a Tree so subject to be mov'd by the Wind, as the Imagination is by every Accident.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What shall I say of the Depravation of our Appetite? What Place is there so filthy, whence such Stench and Vapours arise? Therefore with great Reason it is said in <hi>Ecclesiasticus, What more Wicked than that which Flesh and Blood hath invented?</hi> For who can express the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Abominations, and of Inventions of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Delight, which it finds out every Hour? The Imagination seems to Play, and the Appetite to Dance to its Musick; for it extends its Affection and Desire to all the Objects represented by the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:154273:181"/> Imagination, if we do not presently take care to Curb it with our Reason. But if thou come forth to the Exterior Senses, and observe to how many Dangers the Soul is expos'd only by the Sight, thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much Reason <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> had to say, <hi>What thing is there in the World worse than the Eyes of Man? For what Evil is there that did not spring from them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Loss of Original Justice and Grace through Sin, was the Cause of it. For as Flesh is preserv'd from Corruption with Salt, but if that be wanting, it taints, and breeds Worms; so Human Nature is preserv'd by this Heavenly Gift, but that being lost by Sin, all the Faculties of Man are corrupted and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whence it is that they are so ready for all Evil, and so slow to all that is Good, unless they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd and recover'd by Divine Grace.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Hence also springs the usurp'd Power of Self-Love, which is the First-begotten of Original Sin; for the one turns its Back upon God, and the other turns the Eyes of Love upon it self; loving it self above all things, and even above God. This (St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) partakes in all the Sins of the World, and is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive and promoter of them all: For no Man sins, but for some End which he inordinately loves, and which he preferrs before God, and the Obedience due to his Commandments. Hence flow a Thousand other Evils, which are the Cause of our Ruin. For from hence it comes that Man is so diligent in his own Concerns, and so negligent for those of God: That he is so zealous for his own Honour, and so uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the Honour of God: That he is so eager for his own Profit, and so slack for God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: That he takes so much Pains for what concerns Himself, and is so slothful in stirring a Step for God: That he is so careful for the Health of the Body, and minds so little that of the Soul: That he is so sensible of Temporal Losses, and so insensible of the Spiritual: That he is so much addicted to all Pleasures, and so great an Enemy to all Virtues: That he so much <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>egards the Eyes of Men, and so little the Eyes of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:154273:182"/> God: That he so earnestly labours for the Things of this Life, and fo little for those of the other: That he is so much afflicted at any Corporeal Failing, and makes so small account of a Mortal Sin: And finally, hence it is that Man is so inclin'd to all Evil, and so averse to all that is Good; for he will be drawn to the former by a Thread, that is, by every Fantasie that occurrs; and to move him to the latter, all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the Church, all the Divine Promises and Threats, all the Benefits and Sufferings of Christ, who suffer'd all to this End, are of no Effect. And if thou wilt have me point out to thee by an Example, as it were with a Finger, how ready we are to all that is Evil, and how backward to all that is Good. Observe how much Time and Labour is requisite to excite in thy Heart a little Heat of Devotion, or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Spirit; and how soon it is extinguish'd, after having been kindled; for sometimes it vanishes and is lost whilst thou canst turn thy Head, or speak a Word. On the other hand, if there occurrs to the Imagination an Evil Thought, tho' it be but transient, in a Moment, not only the Appetite, but even the Body is inflam'd; and it sticks so close, that there is need of Force to draw it away. So that an Evil Thought is rather like Fire, than a Thought; since in so short a time it takes hold, burns, and raises a Flame in the Heart. By this we see, how prompt Nature became to Evil, and how unfit to do Good; since for the one it is like dry Tinder, and for the other like green Wood: So that on the one side, one Spark can produce a Fire in a Moment; and on the other, it is hard to blow up a Flame in a long time tho' Fire be appli'd.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. From this Decay and Corruption of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures proceeds another Misery; which is That Man degenerates from the Generosity of hi<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

And thus live not only all the Nations of Infidels and Hereticks, which are very many; but the most part of Catholicks, unless it be here and there one, who lives in the Fear of God.</p>

By which Means wretched Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Beast not only more culpably, but also more prejudicially; for Beasts are so once, but he is doubly a Beast; being a Beast by Appetite, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Beast with his Reason, obliging it to serve his Appetite, and forsake God.

In this same Condition the Devil left our Soul through Sin, as he did the Body of this Holy Man, over which Power was given him. Thus Man was depriv'd of all the Goods of Grace, wounded in all the Gifts of Nature, cast out from Paradise upon the Dunghil of this World, without any other Conveniency to cleanse the Corruption of these Spiritual Sores, (to wit, all his Deprav'd Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) but a Potsherd, which is a Piece of Free-Will: For tho' he has the Power and Liberty not to consent to Sin, yet he is not free from being tempted and assaulted by all sorts of Evil Thoughts. As such a Creature, Man ought to appear in the sight of God: Or, if he will, like that poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Gospel, cover'd with Sores from Head to Foot; desiring to satisfie his Hunger at least with the Crumbs that fall from the plentiful Table of his Divine Mercy, to relieve his present Misery.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. WHEN thou hast thus made Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common Evils of Human Nature, look next upon those that are peculiar to thy Self, as well those of thy past Life, as of the present; that by this thou may'st perceive, how much thou of thy Self hast increas'd thy own Misery; having yet more
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:154273:183"/> corrupted by Actual and Habitual Sin, that which before was deprav'd by Original Sin. For there is nothing so opposite to a Rational Creature, as to Live against the Rules of Reason: Therefore as there is nothing more destructive than Opposites are to one another, so nothing is more destructive to Human Nature, than an Habitual Ill Life.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Reflect then a little on thy past Life, when thou wast farthest remov'd from God; and perhaps thou wilt find, that during all that time thou livedst inordinately, as an Infidel, as a Beast let loose to its own Appetites, as a Child of this World, as a Slave to Sin and Satan, and as a Heathen who has no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. For granting that thou hadst Faith, yet thou therefore didst no more omit to do any Ill, than if thou hadst not had it: For thou didst Swear, Blaspheme, Rob, Covet all thou didst see, as if there were no God, or if thou didst believe all thy End was to be Born, and Die. For generally-speaking, we see that all those upon whom the Light of Grace has not shin'd, live after this manner; without obeying any Law but that of their Flesh, without Regarding any thing but the Eyes of Men, without Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any God but their Belly, and without thinking of any other Good or Evil, but that which relates to the Body.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Having thus made Reflection on the Evils of thy past Life, thou ought'st to cast thy Eyes upon those of thy present Life; that is, on thy daily Evils and Defects; of all which thou must keep so just an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that as a Sick Person shews the Physician all the Parts of his Body which Pain him; so thou also must show them to God, that he may Cure and Heal thee. Consider then whether thou art Passionate, Delicate, Vain-glorious, Curious, Inconstant in Good Purposes, Talkative, Envious, Haughty, Malicious, Unfaithful, Dainty, Conceited, Ambitious, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Slothful, Hard-Hearted, Ill-Condition'd, Testy, Rash, and a Lover of thy Self, of thy own Will and Conceits. The Knowledge hereof is the true Inlet to Humility, and to our true Advancement:
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:154273:184"/> For without this Knowledge, no Man can be truly Humble, or know what he is to Ask of God, or how he shall be Deliver'd from his Evils.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLV.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Second Part of this Exercise, shewing how all the Good we have is from God.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHEN thou hast thus seriously reflected on all the Evils and Miseries that belong to us, it remains to consider, that all the Good we have is from God; that thou may'st the more plainly perceive what thou art of thy Self, and what thou art through Him; and so may'st be Humble in regard of thy Self, and Thankful to Him. And being all Gifts are reduc'd to Three Ranks; to wit, the Gifts of Nature, Gifts of Grace, and Gifts of Fortune, (as the World calls them) reflect on them all, and thou wilt plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they all belong to God, and that nothing is thine but Sin and Vanity it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To begin by the Gifts of Nature, the First is our Being, which is the Ground-work to all the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they all presuppose and belong to the Being. Consider then, that this Rational Soul, which thou hast, and is the Cause of thy Being, is the Gift and Handy-work of God, as Created by him out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What is Nothing? It is the meanest Object that can be conceiv'd by our Imagination; less than a Pebble, than a Straw, than one of the Atoms we see in the Sun-beams; in fine, it is Nothing. Consider then this Nothing as most profound Darkness, and most deep Abyss, which is in the lowest Place, Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all things, and there must thou place thy Self: For this thou art as to thy Self, this thou wert before God created thee, this thou wert from all Eternity till within a few Days: And in so doing, thou wilt fulfil that Command of the Gospel, which bids us seat our selves in the lowest place, when we are invited to the Feast.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:154273:184"/>3. Being seated in this Place next to Nothing, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thou art even that Nothing, and that Place is due to thee; and consequently, that in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Truth is the Center where thy Soul must rest: For nothing is more peculiarly thine, or better suits with thee, than that very Nothing; because as nothing more properly appertains to God, than to Be; so nothing so properly appertains to a Creature, as <hi>Non En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi> This then is the thing in the World that is nearest a-kin, and likest to thee; and wherein as in a Glass, thou may'st see what thou art. Therefore, as Holy <hi>Job</hi> sitting upon the Dunghil, and encompassed with Sores and Worms, said, <hi>I have said to Rottenness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 17.14.</note>
                  <hi>thou art my Father; and to the Worms, ye are my Mother, and my Brethren.</hi> So thou being in reality of thy self Nothing, adhere to Nothing, and say to it, Thou art my Mother and my Sister; for no Sister is so like another, as one <hi>Non Ens</hi> to another. Sit then leisurely in this Place, and (unless thou art quite Blind) thence thou wilt perceive and understand all that is fit for thee to know. Thence thou wilt perceive, That All thou hast, after being made out of Nothing, to wit, thy Body, Soul, Life, Health, Strength, Reason, Sense, with all other Natural Faculties and Endowments, is not thy own, but the meer Mercy and Gift of God. Thence thou wilt perceive how much thou art oblig'd to Love, Praise, Serve, Obey, and Please him that freely gave thee all this; for Nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves Nothing. Thence thou wilt perceive how far all Arrogance, Presumption, Pride, Vain-Glory and Self-Esteem; ought to be from thee. For as he that sees a Horse with Rich Furniture, and cover'd with Gold and Silk, believes that no part of it is the Horse's own, but belongs to another, and is only laid upon him; and therefore he has no Cause to Value himself upon it: So thou may'st conceive, That All thou hast above Nothing, belongs to another, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd and communicated by God; and consequently thou hast no Cause to Glory in it. Thence thou wilt perceive the Folly and Stupidity of Men, and the Vanity of their Thoughts: Since they are so
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:154273:185"/> forgetful of their Original, (that is, of him that gave them all) and so much deceiv'd in the Knowledge of themselves. This Consideration will cause thee to weigh thy Self justly, to humble thy Thoughts, to bring down thy Pride, to submit thy self to God: And here thou wilt find thy Center, a Place of Refuge, and a secure Port to fly to, as often as thy Heart shall be toss'd in the Sea of Vanity: And thou wilt find by Experience, that there are not in the World Two such proper Places for Man's Heart, as GOD and Nothing; for in only these two it rests secure, in all others it is rack'd: In the one it is in Charity, as being in God; and in the other it is in Humility and Truth, as being in the true Knowledge of it Self. Behold here then, Good Christian, whose that Being is, which thou hast.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And who can deny, but that all other Gifts of Nature belong to the Author and Lord of Nature? And if thou wilt yet look farther, thou wilt find that all things in this World, the Heavens, and all that is contain'd within them, are Part of this Benefit; because all these things contribute, every one in its Way, to our Support.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now as to the Gifts, the World calls, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they are not bestow'd by Fortune, (for there is no such thing as Fortune) but by God alone; as is expresly declar'd by <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 11.14.</note> in these Words; <hi>Good Things and Evil, Life and Death, Poverty and Honesty, are of God.</hi> For tho' these things seem to come by other Secondary Causes, yet it is certain that nothing is done in this World, but by express Command of that Supreme King who Governs it. Therefore St. <hi>Basil</hi> says, <hi>That all Christian Philosophy consists in attributing the Causes of all Things, as well great as small, to God; since it appears to us by the Gospel, that a Sparrow doth not fall to the Ground,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.29.</note>
                  <hi>without his Will and Permission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Then for the Gifts of Grace, the very Name declares whose they are, and why they are given, to wit, of the meer Grace and Mercy of God. For (as has been said above) Man through Sin became so Poor, so Naked, and so Unfit for all that is Good,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:154273:185"/> that of himself he cannot move Hand or Foot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any thing that is Good; nor so much as open his Mouth to call upon the Name of JESUS, so as to please him, unless GOD himself excite and assist him with his Grace. So that all the good Wishes, Thoughts, and Purposes he has had in his whole Life, are all his Gifts and Mercies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if thou wouldst run through all the Gifts of Grace, which are subservient for the Working of our Salvation, thou wilt perceive they are all Mercies and Bounties of God. Amongst them, the First is the Grace of Predestination, which is the First of all Graces, and the Ground-work of them. It is a clear Case, that this is the pure Bounty and Mercy of God; because it presupposes no Merit, but is before all Merit, and proceeds only from the Good-will and Liking of God. The Second is the Grace of Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Justification, whereby God calls a Man from Sin, brings him into a State of Grace, and of an Enemy makes him a Friend. This also appears to be the Free Gift and Mercy of God, and is void of all Merit; because a Man being in a State of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Enemy to God, can do nothing to merit so great a Good. The Third is that which is call'd Concomitant Grace; which attends us in a Good Life, and renders our Actions pleasing to God, and meritorious of Eternal Life. This tho' it proceeds from our Merits, is still a free Gift, because our Merit proceeds from Grace. The Fourth is the Gift or Grace of Perseverance; which makes us persevere to the End in a good Life, without faultring by the Way. This is also the Bounty and Mercy of God, and so absolutely a Free Grace, that it is void of all Merit; because no Man is capable of performing any Work that can merit so great a Good. Without this Grace, all the rest is of little value: For (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> says) among Christians, it is not the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the End that is to be commended. St. <hi>Paul</hi> began ill, but ended well: <hi>Judas</hi> on the other side made a good Beginning, but a reprobate End. The Fifth is the Heavenly Glory, which is a consummated
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:154273:186"/> Grace, and this also is a free Gift; for (as the Apostle says) <hi>Through the Grace of God, Eternal Life is given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. If thou hast any of the other Graces, which are stiled <hi>Gratis datae,</hi> the very Name expresses that they are freely given, and consequently are all due to the Giver. Behold then, how all that is within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, belongs to God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now what follows from hence? That hereafter thou look upon God as the Fountain and Origin of thy self, of all that is within and without thee, and of all that thou art and canst be; and that consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou no longer Worship thy Fleshly Strength, thy Industry, or thy Wisdom, but only him; since from him alone proceeds all that thou wast, art, and hopest to be. Considering what has been said, how canst thou look upon so great and good a Lord? I will set down some Comparisons to this purpose, that thou may'st the better know how thou art to behold him; and take notice, that from this sort of Aspects are deriv'd all the Influences of the true Son of Justice upon our Souls.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Behold him then, as all Effects behold their Causes, from which they have all their Being, and to which they are always Subject, and pay Submission; for he is the Universal Cause of all Causes, and ought to be regarded as such. Behold him, as the Son doth his Father, who is the Cause of his Being; for he is our Father, and the Cause and Original of our Being. Behold him as the Bride does her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, on whom depends all her present and future Happiness; for he is the true Bridegroom, who alone gives true Contentment to our Souls. Behold him, as the Body does the Soul, from whom it receives all the Life, Dignity and Honour it has; for he is as it were the Soul of our Soul, and Life of our Life. Behold him, as the Earth naturally beholds Heaven, of whom it receives all the Fertility and Beauty it has; for he is the Spiritual Heaven, that Enlightens and Governs us, and from whom proceeds all our Life and Beauty. Behold him, as the Sun-Beams do the Sun it self, from whom they proceed, and by whom
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:154273:186"/> they are supported; for it is he that gave us all the Being we have, and who always preserves us in it. To conclude, behold him with such Eyes as the most Sacred Humanity of Christ beholds the Divine Word, to whom it is United, and from whom it Receives all the Perfections it has, even its very Being and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; which manner of beholding is the most Humble, most Chaste, most Beautiful, and most Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that Human Understanding is capable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending. Do thou therefore, in some measure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to imitate this manner of beholding, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit and Grace thou shalt receive from our Lord.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now according to this that has been said, if all thy Being, and all the Good thou hast had, hast at present, and shalt have, proceed from this Lord, whom shalt thou Regard, whom shalt thou Fear, whom shalt thou Please, Obey, Worship and Praise, in whom shalt thou Hope, to whom shalt thou be truly Faithful, but to him, or for his sake? Cast from thee then all Human Regards, put away all Earthly Respects, since thou hast nothing to do with them, nor they with thee, but only the Creator and Lord of all. Turn then to this Lord with all thy Heart, and say as follows.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Lord, if thou art my Beginning, and my End, whom shall I Love, but thee? If thou art my Lord and my King, whom shall I Obey but thee? If all my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Unhappiness is in thy Hands, whom shall I Fear, and Worship, but thee? If from only thy Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hand I have receiv'd all I have, and from it I hope to receive all I want, in whom shall I place my Hope, but in thee? If thou alone art my Father, my Lord, my Creator, and my Governor, to whom shall I have recourse in all my Necessities, but to thee? If from thee I have receiv'd, and daily do receive so many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, to whom shall I return Thanks and Praises, but to thee alone? And if Servants serve their Kings and Lords so faithfully and diligently in Affairs of great Trouble and Danger, for what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and hope to receive from them, why shall
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:154273:187"/> not I serve thee, my God, of whom I have receiv'd, and hope to receive so much more than they, with much greater Fidelity, greater Diligence, and greater Care, and through greater Dangers? For thou, O Lord, deservest more, and I owe thee more, and it is beyond all comparison much more that I hope from thee.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Thanksgiving, Offertory, and Petition.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL that has been said hitherto appertains to the Knowledge of our selves, after which may very well follow those Three Parts we mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which ought to be inserted in every Act of Prayer, and are the Thanksgiving, Offertory, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. These, besides that they are so essential and beneficial in Prayer, are besides so knit and hung to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether among themselves, that each of them, after a wonderful manner draws in the other. For there is no Introduction so fit for the Exercise of Prayer, as the Accusing and Knowledge of our selves, and thus we enter the way of Humility, as was said before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After this Knowledge, nothing follows more naturally than the Thanksgiving for the Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of God. For when a Man has considered that of himself he is Nothing, and is satisfy'd and convinc'd herein, his Eyes are presently enlightned, and he plainly perceives that all he has above No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is another's, and freely given him by the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God. The more plainly he sees this, the more heartily he thanks God for it. So that, as Scouts go up into some high Tower, that they may from thence better discover all parts of the Countrey; so on the other side, he who would discover what he owes to God, must place himself in the lowest part of the World; that is, turn to that Nothing, from whence he came, for from this Watch-Tower he will most plainly discover, that all he has is God's; that is, all he has above Nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:154273:187"/>3. After this Thanksgiving for Benefits receiv'd, there most aptly follows the Offertory; that is, to give something on our part to him that has given us so much. And because there is nothing so fit to give as the Merits and Sufferings of Christ, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that on account of such Merits we should ask great Favours; therefore it is that after the Offertory, the Petition, which is the last part of this Exercise, follows of course.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is another great conveniency in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, which is, that as it is very short for those who have much Business, so it may be very long for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Persons; for in each of these Parts there is much to meditate upon, as well in the Knowledge of our selves, as in the Thanksgiving, and as well in the Consideration of the Divine Benefits, which are so many, and so great, as in the Offertory; for a Man may run through all the Passages and Mysteries of the Life of Christ, offering them all, and each in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to the Eternal Father. In the Petition also there is much to ask, since we stood in need of so many things.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After all, I have thought fit to advertise such as are Masters of their own time, and desire to improve themselves more in the Service of God, that they may twice every Day retire themselves, once to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon the Life of our Saviour, and the other time to Examine their Conscience, and Study the Knowledge of themselves; using either the Method that has been here set down, or any other they shall like better. But if by reason of Business, or the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incumbent on them, they can withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but once in a Day, let them begin by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of themselves, for the Just Man is at first his own Accuser, then let them proceed to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Life of Christ, for this is the most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and most copious Subject for Meditation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. As to the First Point, it is to be presuppos'd, that, (as <hi>Prosper</hi> in his Book of a <hi>Contemplative Life,</hi>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:154273:188"/> says) <hi>Charity is a Holy Will, abstracted from all Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things, and united to God: Enflam'd with the Fire of the Holy Ghost, from whom it proceeds, and to whom it tends; free from all Impurity, estrang'd from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, above all Change, unacquainted with all that is Carnally Lov'd, the most Powerful of all Affections, in Love with Divine Contemplation, a Conqueror of all Worldly Things, an Epitome of all Good Works, the End of the Heavenly Commandments, the Death of Vice, the Life of Virtue, the Courage of those that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, the Crown of those that Overcome, the Armour of Holy Souls, the Cause of all Merit; without which no body pleases God, and with which no body displeases him; Fruitful in those that Begin, Pleasing in those that are Advanc'd, Glorious in those that Persevere, Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Martyrs, and a continual Labourer in all the Faithful.</hi> Thus far are the Words of <hi>Prosper;</hi> by which in some manner is briefly declar'd what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, and how great its Fruits and Excellencies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its chiefest Excellency is, that it is the Greatest of all Virtues, the End and Epitome of them all. A Proof hereof, is the Dignity of those Supream Spirits call'd <hi>Seraphims,</hi> in whom Charity is most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, above all the other Choirs of Angels; and for this Reason, they enjoy the Highest Place among them, because they exceed them in this Virtue, which is the chiefest of all Virtues. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> says, that all those who in this World are Inflam'd with the Love of God, belong to this Order. These are his Words: <hi>There are some, who being Inflam'd with the Contemplation of Heavenly Things, Burn with the Desire of their Creator; they Ccvet nothing else in this World, they Live upon the Love of Eternity, they Despise all Earthly Things, their Spirit is above all that is Temporal; they Love and Burn, and in this Love they Repose: Loving they Burn, and Talking they Inflame others, and make those Burn whom they but Touch with their Words. Then what shall I call these Men, but Seraphims, whose Heart being converted into Fire, Shines and Burns?</hi> Thus far are the Words of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:154273:189"/>4. There is another great Excellency belonging to Charity, which is (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says) that God himself is call'd Charity, whence it is, that it has a great likeness with God. Therefore as God is all things, so Charity in some measure is all things; since it is good for all, and gives Life and Perfection to all. For in the first place, Charity makes Men Holy, because (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) according to the Degree of Charity is the Degree of Sanctity; and a Man will be so much the more Holy, by how much the more he Loves God. Charity also makes Men Wise; according to that of the Psalmist, who says, <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is bright, and so enlightens the Eyes of the Soul.</hi> Wherefore S. <hi>Augustin</hi> said, <hi>Whosoever would Know God so as to Please him, let him Love, and he will Know Him.</hi> It is Charity likewise which makes Prelates worthy of the Name. Therefore our Lord intending to make St. <hi>Peter</hi> Prince of his Church, Examined him as to no Point but this Virtue, asking three times, <hi>Whether he Loved him more than the other Apostles.</hi> Charity also makes Martyrs; for all that were such, were so through the Force of this Virtue: For, (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says) <hi>There is nothing in the World more powerful than Love.</hi> Charity also makes Virgins; for, (as St. <hi>John Climacus</hi> says) <hi>He is Chaste, who with one Love overcomes another, and with the Flame of the Spirit conquers the Sensual Flame of the Flesh.</hi> Charity makes Man Victorious over all Temptations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ravenna</hi> says, <hi>Do thou, O Man, Love God, and Love him with all thy Heart, that so thou may'st without Difficulty overcome all the Temptations of the Enemy of Mankind.</hi> Observe, that it is an easie Combat, and soft manner of Fight, to Triumph over all Vice, through the Sweetness of Love. In fine, Charity is the Perfection and Fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets, as the Apostle testified, when he said, <hi>The Fulfilling of the Law is Love, for in this Word all is comprehended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Love of God is also like God, in the Qualities and Noble Properties it has, which are suitable to those of God: For, (as a Divine says)
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:154273:189"/>
                     <hi>Love is Noble, Generous, Wise, Beautiful, a Worker of Great Things; it is Sweet, Strong, Fruitful, Simple, Chaste, Ʋnconquerable, and Conqueror of All Things. Love is all Joyful, all Gracious, all Pleasing, and all Admirable. Love pierces, breaks, raises and humbles, and overcomes all Difficulties. Love is lofty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, wounds and heals, and kills and raises; cannot be hid, nor requited, but with Love, and gives all for Love; because it seeks, nor requires nothing but Love. The Heart of him that truly Loves, always thinks on Love, and the Tongue always speaks of Love, it recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the Memory, enlightens the Ʋnderstanding, inflames the Will, surprizes the Senses, sanctifies the Soul, and transforms all Man into God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now the Premises being granted, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that all our Care and Industry be employ'd in obtaining this Virtue, since it brings with it such Rare and Excellent Virtues: This we read our Lord taught a Holy Soul, to whom, among other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Instructions, he said; <hi>When thou sayest the Lord's Prayer, reflect upon this Word,</hi> Thy Will be done, <hi>and labour all that in thee is to conform thy Will to the Divine Will in all things,</hi> (as well fortunate as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate) <hi>which God shall allot thee. When thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatest the Angelical Salutation, stay upon the Name of</hi> Jesus, <hi>which must be always fixt in thy Heart; that it may be to thee a Shield, a Guide, a Pleasure in the Course of this Life, and in all the Necessities thereof. And from the whole Holy Scripture, take this Word Love, which will make thee always Walk upright, pure, active, careful, diligent; for it is able to perform all things without being Weary, without Fearing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trouble; insomuch that through it even Martyrdom becomes sweet.</hi> It is impossible to express the least part of the Virtue and Force of True Love, and of the Works it performs; it will help thee to destroy all thy Wicked Inclinations, and all thy Inordinate Appetites and Sentiments of the Things of this World.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But amidst all these Praises, there is nothing more invites us to the Admiration and Desire of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:154273:190"/> this Virtue, than the Knowledge we have, That in it consists not only the Perfection of Christian Life, but also much of the Felicity and Happiness which a Human Heart is capable of attaining in this Life. For, (as <hi>Boetius</hi> says) <hi>All the Life of Man, which is spent in so many Labours and Cares, aims at nothing through these Means, but at one End, which is its Felicity and Happiness.</hi> This Happiness consists in a Man's obtaining a Good wherein consists all Good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Will finding all here, has no Occasion to seek for more than it has found, nor can it covet any more, having here all it desires.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This Good can be no other than God, therefore out of him Man can find no perfect Satisfaction, nor can he want it in him: And tho' this be chiefly reserv'd for the next Life, when God will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly possess'd in Glory; yet in some measure it is obtain'd in this, where he is less perfectly possess'd through Grace. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> declares he enjoy'd and possess'd him after this manner, when in a Treatise he wrote of the Love of God; he says, <hi>Being come into the House of Solitude, like a Solitary Creature that dwells in a desart and lonesom Country, beginning to feel the Air of Love, I open'd my Mouth, and drew in the Spirit: And sometimes, O Lord, when I Sighing for thee, as it were with my Eyes shut, thou layest on the Mouth of my Heart something, which it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for me to know what it is. I am sensible of the Taste, and of the Sweetness, which so comforts me, that if it were plentifully given, I could wish for nothing more.</hi> Thus far the Words of St. <hi>Bernard;</hi> with which▪ tho' under different Similitudes, agree those of the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> saying, <hi>I sleep, and my Heart watcheth.</hi> Why? What is the meaning of this? But that, as he that sleepeth, has during that time all his Senses becalm'd and useless; for he neither sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor desires any thing: So sometimes God communicates himself to the Soul with great Sweetness and Love, and pours on it as it were a Sea of Quiet; with which she is so pleas'd, so satisfi'd, and so satiated, that during that time
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:154273:190"/> she sleeps to all the Desires and Cares of this World, and has no more regard of them than one that sleeps.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He does not only call it Sleep, but in another place of the same Book, calls it Death, saying, <hi>Love is strong as Death;</hi> which words a Holy Man expounds, saying, <hi>That the force of the Love of God is so great, when in Perfection, that with the violence of its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it Ravishes all the Faculties of our Soul, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time Mortifies them to all the Delights and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of this World.</hi> This is the property of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which Holy Men term Violent. For the Joy and Sweetness this sort of Charity brings along with it is so great, that it Powerfully, tho' Sweetly, Ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes and Draws after it all the Sense of our Souls, and withdraws it from the Love and Esteem of all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, fixing it upon God. By another Name, this is call'd Charity that wounds, for it so wounds and pierces the Heart, that as he who is wounded cannot forbear thinking upon the Pain of his Wound, so he that is wounded with this Love, cannot, without much difficulty, remove his thought from the Object he Loves. For as when a Pain is sharp a Man cannot forbear thinking on it, so the same happens with Pleasure when it is great, because the power of two Contraries is equal. To this purpose, we read of one of the Ancient <hi>Anchorets,</hi> that went to another to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row something that was in his Cell, he going in to fetch it, presently forgot what he went for, and this happening three or four times, at last he desir'd him that came, to go in and look for it himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not remember what it was he ask'd for, tho' but so short a time; so strangely was his Soul wrapp'd in God. Nor is this to be admir'd at, for doubtless Spiritual things are of that Quality and Worth, that the Soul, which through the assistance of the Holy Ghost once understands and relishes them, can scarce look upon any thing of this World, tho' never so Excellent. Thus it is written of the Abbot <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus,</hi> that when he came forth from Prayer, all Earthly things appear'd to him so mean and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, that he would shut his Eyes, that he might
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:154273:191"/> not see them; and speaking to himself, would say, <hi>Shut your selves up, my Eyes, shut your selves up, and look not upon any Worldly Thing, for there is nothing in it worth beholding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. What powerful Arguments and Examples these are, to give us to understand how far the force of this Love reaches; and how sweet and pleasing this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Affection is. And if thou requirest another Example, hear what the Holy St. <hi>Hierome</hi> relates of the Delights and Exercises wherewith God Nourish'd and Employ'd his Soul, being, as he says, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, burnt up with the heat of the Sun; <hi>Where there was a high Clift, or deep Dale,</hi> says he, <hi>that was my place of Prayer: And as the Lord is my Witness, after many Prayers, and fixing my Eyes upon Heaven, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I seem'd to be among the Choirs of Angels, and I sang with Joy and Delight. After thee, O Lord, we run, in the Odour of thy Perfumes.</hi> Thus he writes to the Virgin <hi>Eustochium.</hi> But writing to other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Consecrated to God, he says thus; <hi>Believe, my Children, an experienced Old Man: If you have once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the sweetness of our Lord, you may have heard this word from him: Come, and I will shew you all the Goods. Then will he shew you such things, as no Body can know, but he that has tasted them. I know, dear Sisters, what I say, and yet, confessing my Ignorance, I say, that I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Man, and so contemptible in the House of our Lord, being still in this Body, have been many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Choirs of Angels, subsisting some Days upon the sweetness of this Food. After which, being restor'd to my Body, and having obtain'd the knowledge of many things to come, I lamented for what I had lost. But how great the Happiness was I enjoy'd during that time, and how unspeakable the Sweetness I was there sensible of, the most Blessed Trinity is my Witness, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that were present are my Witnesses, and my own Conscience is my Witness, which enjoy'd such great Bliss, that the weakness of my Tongue cannot express it.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after he adds, <hi>The Heart full of Earthly Business cannot lift it self up to the Sweetness of this Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it must Die to the World, and Live to only
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:154273:191"/> God, through holy Meditations and Desires. For (as our Saviour says) the Grain of Corn that falls to the Ground, if it Die not, remains alone; but if it Die, produces much Fruit.</hi> Thus far are the Words of St. <hi>Hierome.</hi> Then what shall I say of the Blessed St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> who was often so wrapt in God, that the Body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Spirit, and was lifted up, and other times he remain'd quite void of all Sence? Thus it once fell out, that being in this condition, with a Candle in his Hand, the Candle burnt out, and he burnt his Hand without feeling it, but the Sores remain'd on his Hand as a Testimony of it. Another time, being to be Seer'd with a Hot Iron, he fell to Prayer, and was so wrapt and abstracted in God, that he never felt it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If we admire at this, we ought no less to be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd at what <hi>Aristotle</hi> writes, who speaking of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Contemplation of a Wise and Perfect Man, says, <hi>That sometimes the Life of a Wise Man attains to be such, as is always the Life of the first Principle, which is God.</hi> Signifying hereby, that he sometimes partakes of that Peace, Tranquility and Felicity, which God always enjoys. Now if this was said by a Man, who knew not any thing of the Grace or Supernatural Love of God, infus'd by the Holy Ghost, what may they say who know and possess the wonderful Effects and Works of the Holy Ghost? For if a meer Moral Habit, and Human Study, and Learning, can raise a Man to such a Condition, that whilst it lasts he shall say, he is like God, quiet, satisfy'd, and free from all Desires; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we think will the Graces and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the Perfection of the Gospel raise him? Now if this be so, think you not that it will be reasonable to buy this Precious Pearl, and give all that shall be ask'd for it? For if Men do and suffer so much for the Imperfect Goods of this World, (which rather increase than quench the Thirst of our Soul) what ought to be done for a Good that so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely removes the Covetousness and Desire of all other Goods? <hi>He is Rich, who has Gold in his Chest,</hi> (says St. <hi>Augustin) and shall not he be so, who has God in his Conscience?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">

                     <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> That the Soul ought not to Rest, till it finds Divine Love in Perfection; and of the Effects it causes in her.</head>
                     <p n="12">12. THIS then is one of the Principal Motives, among many others, which should oblige us never to rest, till we find this Precious Treasure. A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Doctor invites us to it, with Sweet and Powerful Words, to this Effect. Whereas it is certain that God, who is the Infinite and Supream Good, can settle the Desires of a Rational Soul, therefore ought Man to strive for the Perfection of Christian Life; that by means thereof he may be united to this Supream Good, and partake of it. For if he should attain to this, without doubt he would receive God within him, with Superabundant Grace; who by his Divine and Pleasing Presence would banish from his Soul all Poverty and Misery, and would enrich it with True Riches, and fill it with Unspeakable Joy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Man would no more seek False Delights in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for all that is not Good, would be displeasing to him. We see the Rational Soul is so Capacious and Noble, that no Fading Good can satisfie it; for it is plain, that what in it self is less, cannot fill that which is greater. It is also certain that the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, and all Visible Things, are much less than Man; for none of these Things, nor all of them together, can satisfie his Will: Only GOD is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than he, and therefore with him alone is he fill'd and satisfi'd, and not with any lesser thing. Even the Angels themselves are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to content him; for tho' they be greater by Nature, they are not so in Capacity. Therefore as long as Man does not possess this only Supream Good, and Embrace it with the Arms of Love, he will ever continue Distracted without Repose, full of Anxiety without Quiet, and Hungry without true Fulness. And tho' he be fill'd with all the Riches and Pleasures of the World, he will not obtain the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:154273:192"/> Content he desires, unless it be by being touch'd with this Divine Love. But when he has once found this Supream Good, he will easily renounce all Creatures, and say with the Psalmist; <hi>It is good for me to adhere to God;</hi> and with Holy <hi>Job, I will dwell in my Nest, and like a Dove will multiply the Days.</hi> Such a Man no longer looks for Earthly Consolations without himself, because he has within himself Him that is an Ocean of Inestimable Consolations, and of all that Human Heart can desire. He is so touch'd with the experienc'd Taste and Knowledge of God, and so plainly dives into the Truth of all Mysteries of Faith; that if all the Men in the World should say to him, <hi>Thou art deceiv'd, unhappy Man, thou art deceiv'd, for the Faith thou Professest is not True;</hi> he would confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Answer, <hi>It is you that are wretched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, for what I Believe is Infallible Truth.</hi> This would he Answer with great Assurance, not only through the Habit and Light of Faith, that would move him to it; but also through the Experience and Taste of God he has; which is so great and wonderful, that when it takes Possession of a Soul, it brings with it the Tokens and Proofs of what it is. Such as are thus United with God, cannot chuse but be his very Familiar Friends: And consequently, they often by their Prayers obtain of him greater Benefits for the Church in one Hour, than many others who are not such, do in many Years.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Such Men do also enjoy a Wonderful Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Tranquility and Liberty, which raises them above all the Cares and Troubles of this World; and above all Fears of Death, Hell, and Purgatory; and above all the Calamities that can befal them in this Life; because their whole Confidence being placed in God, they despise all Earthly Things. And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Company of Men, nor Exterior Business, separate them from the Inward Presence of God; because they are already us'd and habituated to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Unity and Simplicity of Spirit, amidst the multitude of Business; as having received Essential Stability, and a Perpetual Introversion of the Heart
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:154273:193"/> to God. Hence it is, that from all that they see or hear, they deduce Motives for Lifting up their Hearts to him: So that all things (if we may so express it) become God to them, since in them all their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seeks nothing but him. These Persons being within themselves so taken up with God, do walk as if they were alienated from their Senses; Seeing things like Blind Men, Hearing like the Deaf, and Speaking like the Dumb; because all their Spirits being transferr'd to God, they walk among Creatures, as if they were not with them. Thus they live an Angelical and Supernatural Life, for which Reason they may be call'd Angels upon Earth; since it is only their Body that converses upon Earth, and all the rest is in Heaven. Such was the Spirit, the Life, and the Conversation of all the Saints; after whose Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the Faithful ought to direct their Intentions and Desires.</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of the Eight several Degrees of the Love of GOD.</head>
                     <p n="14">14. BUT here it is to be observ'd, That it is not every Degree of Charity which is sufficient to give Man this Inward Peace and Content we speak of, but only Perfect Charity. Wherefore it is to be understood, That as this Virtue increases, so it works the more Excellent Effects upon the Soul. For in the first place, (when God so ordains) it brings with it an Experimental Knowledge of the Goodness, Sweetness, and Excellency of God: From which Knowledge springs an Inflaming of the Will, and from this Inflaming springs a Pleasure, from this Pleasure a most earnest Desire of God, and from the Desire a new Contentment, from the Contentment a sort of Inebriation, and from this a Security and full Repose in God, in whom our Soul rests, and keeps a Spiritual Sabbath with him.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. By this it appears, That these Eight Degrees are so link'd together, that one makes way for the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:154273:193"/> other, and that which goes before, prepares and opens a Door for that which follows. The First Degree, <hi>viz.</hi> That Experimental Knowledge of God, is the principal Gate, through which the Gifts and Benefits of God are receiv'd into the Soul, and enrich it. For from this Knowledge, which consists in the Understanding, (tho' deriv'd from the taste of the Will) proceeds an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming of the same Will; through which it Burns with the Love of that Infinite Goodness and Mercy which it has there discover'd. From this Fire springs a most Sweet Pleasure, which is that Hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> which no body knows but he that has tasted of it; which is a Natural Property attending Love, and proceeding from it, even as Light naturally proceeds from the Sun. This is one of the Principal Methods God uses to withdraw Men from the World, and to wean them from Sensual Pleasures. For this Delight so far exceeds all other Delights, that for it Man easily renounces them all.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Now because Spiritual Things are so Excellent and Divine, that the more they are Tasted, the more they are Coveted; from this Relish of them springs a most vehement Desire of Enjoying and Possessing this Treasure, because the Soul finds no Pleasure or Satisfaction in any other thing. And this Supream Good being to be obtain'd by Laborious Virtue, a Rigorous Life, and by Imitating our Lord, who says, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and no body comes to my Father, but through me;</hi> hence flows another most Ardent Desire, not only of Meditating upon, but of Imitating the Life of our Lord, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Footsteps. Now his Footsteps are Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Patience, Obedience, Poverty, Hardship, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Mercy, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. To this Desire, follows a Fulness of Satiety, (such as can be obtain'd in this Life) for God gives not Desires to his Servants to Afflict them, but to Fulfil them, and to dispose them for greater things. And as it is he who Kills, and raises to Life; so also is it he, who gives his Servants the Desire and Satiety, which produces in the Soul such a Distaste of all
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:154273:194"/> Worldly things, that it in a manner tramples upon them; and remains it self peaceful, satisfi'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with only this most Sweet Food, in which it finds all Pleasure and Delight; and perceives, that a Rational Creature can find perfect Satisfaction in no other thing.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. After this follows the Inebriation, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Satiety; to which the Spouse in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> invites us, and through which the Soul forgets all transitory things, and even it self at times; being wholly plung'd in the Abyss of the Infinite Goodness and Sweetness of GOD.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. From this Heavenly Inebriation follows the Seventh Degree, which is Security; tho' not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Perfect, as that in Heaven; but such as is suitable to this Life, which is greater than can be imagin'd, and causes a Man joyfully to Sing with the Prophet, (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> translates it) saying, <hi>Thou, O Lord, hast made me dwell safe in Confidence.</hi> For having by these Means had Experience of the Infinite Goodness and Fatherly Providence of God, it comes to enjoy a wonderful Security and Confidence in this Providence; which causes it courageously to speak those Words of the Prophet; <hi>The Lord is our Refuge and our Strength, therefore we will not fear, tho' the Earth be troubled, and the Mountains overturned, and fall into the middle of the Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. From this Security and Confidence, proceeds the Tranquility of the Soul, which is Perfect Rest, and a Spiritual Quiet, an Inward Silence, a Quiet Sleep on the Bosom of our Lord; and in short, that Place which the Apostle says exceeds all Human Sense; for no Human Capacity can comprehend it, unless it has experienc'd it. The Blessing of these Two last Degrees our Lord promis'd to his Elect, by the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> saying, <hi>I will seat my People in the Beauty of Peace, in the Tabernacles of Security, and in a full Repose, abounding with all Goods.</hi> This is, Dear Christian, the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth, and the Paradise which we can enjoy in this World; this is the Treasure that is hidden
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:154273:194"/> from the Eyes of the World, in the Field of the Gospel; to Buy which, the Wise Merchant Sells all that he has.</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>III.</hi> How it is much to be Lamented, that Man should not earnestly Labour to obtain the Divine Love.</head>
                     <p n="21">21. NOW what Man is there, who hearing what has been said, and knowing that the Divine Grace, is as free for him, as for any of the Saints, will not labour to enter this Way, to enjoy such Blessings in this Life? O unhappy and blind Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> why seek ye with so much Labour, and in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Places, that which with less trouble is found all together in God alone? Verily the Ways of <hi>Sion</hi> weep, because there are none that come to this Solemnity, where the Faithful Soul reposes and rejoices in God. For if it be true, (as before we urg'd out of <hi>Boetius,</hi>) that all the Cares and Labours of Men tend to one End; which is, to Satisfie and Please their Will; a thing that cannot be obtain'd but in God, who is our Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End; What Madness then is it to seek this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Content, where it is not? Men Travel to <hi>India,</hi> and Ransack the Sea and Land, seeking those things wherein they expect to find Repose: But they do not consider how great a Mistake it is, to seek with so much Labour that without, which ought to be sought within themselves. Does not our Saviour say that the Kingdom of God is within us? And what else is this Kingdom, but (as the Apostle says) Justice, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost? Here Justice is as it were the Root of this Blessing; but the Peace and Joy, are as it were the Fruit growing from this Root, wherein consists our Quiet and Felicity. This is signifi'd to us by those two Names of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech,</hi> who was called King of Justice, and King of Peace; which two things are always so conjoin'd, that Peace is never to be found without Justice, or Justice without Peace. Therefore in vain does he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:154273:195"/> labour to find Peace, and true Joy, who seeks it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Justice, and a good Conscience.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. There are some, who hearing what has been here said, begin presently to dispose themselves to seek God, but not with such Humility, Simplicity, and Resolution, as is requisite for such an Affair. These having not cast deep Roots; that is, having no strong good Purposes, or true Love of God, immediately wither with the first Heat; for yielding to some Difficulty they meet with at the first Entrance, they presently turn back from the Way. There are others, who often fall, and rise again; sometimes dismay, and despond, and otherwhiles take courage, and grow hearty; these, tho' often stumbling, yet at last, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by Divine Grace, improve, and attain their End. There are others, who say, It is enough for us to Live as others do, what need we be singular, and do strange things, since we may be Sav'd without? Thus Men struggle at first, because the Carnal and the Spiritual Will are at variance, and Divine and Worldly Love contend. And Worldly Love being strong at first, it opposes the Divine Love, because it would not lose its hold, and the Power it has had over Man from his Infancy. It is not to be deny'd, but this Separation is very troublesom; but the Grace of God, a steady Resolution and Perseverance, overcome all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Because the Spiritual Exercises being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd, the Superior Part of the Soul by little and little grows strong against the Inferior; after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Superior Part receives greater Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Delight from God, and the Inferior Part lesser Satisfaction from the World; and therefore Corrupt Nature falls under the Power of Divine Grace. A continual Exercise of Devout Reading, Prayer, and Meditation, Sanctifies and Purifies our Heart; which being so Purifi'd, begins to taste how Sweet our Lord is, and having tasted the Spiritual Sweetness, loses the Relish of all Fleshly Things; and then Man runs nimbly in the Ways of God, after the Odour of his Ointments. Thus if Man always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his Pious Exercises, his Good Desires always
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:154273:195"/> increase, and he always finds new Nourishment to <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <head type="sub">How the Perfection of Christian Life consists in the Perfection of Charity, and which is the Perfection of this Virtue.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is a common Expression of all the Saints, That the Perfection of Christian Life consists in the Perfection of Charity; wherefore the Apostle calls it, <hi>The Bond of Perfection;</hi> and in another Place, <hi>The End of the Law.</hi> The Reason is, because (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> says) then any thing is in its full Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when it has attain'd its End for which it was Created; for then it can rise no more, being come to the highest Step. It appears, that the Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End and Center of a Rational Creature is God; in whom alone is found all that Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can comprehend, and all that the Will can love, as in an Universal Good, that comprehends all things. Whence it follows, that the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Creature must consist principally in that Virtue, whose peculiar Property it is to Unite Man to this Supream Good, and make him as it were One same thing with it; which is proper to Charity, that Unites Man to God through Love, and makes him the same Substance with him; as S. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist testifies in these Words: <hi>God is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and he that is in Charity is in God, and God in him.</hi> Thus it is manifest, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:154273:196"/> in its proper Center, and makes it Attain its ultimat<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> End, in it consists the Perfection of Christian Life▪ and therefore, proportionable to the degree of its Perfection, will be the Perfection of this Life. So that he who is perfect in Charity, will be perfect in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But you will ask, Wherein consists the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Charity? The same Doctor answers, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>There are three degrees, or sorts of Perfection in this Virtue. The first belongs only to God, the second to those who visibly see God, and the third to those, who in this Life, through Grace, are going to God.</hi> The first and Supream Perfection of Charity, which belongs only to God, is to love him as much as he deserves, which none can do but himself; because as he only perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehends himself, so only he perfectly loves himself. The second Perfection is of those who visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly see God in his Glory, who love him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their Strength, and this continually without ever ceasing, or being able to cease. For, as he whose Eyes are open cannot but see the Object that is before him, so the Will having the Supream Good before it, as its Object, cannot cease to love it continually and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, with all its Strength, and the utmost of its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for the Excellency of this Good so wraps and draws it after it, that it cannot cease to love it always with such Vehemency. The third Perfection is of those who love God in this Life; which tho' it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach to the height of the Blessed, yet it strives as much as possible to attain to it, and to this purpose labours to cast off not only all Sins, but also all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles that hinder it from actually loving God, or that may cool its Affection towards him. And whereas all these Impediments spring from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence of Self-Love, therefore all that is against this Concupiscence; and according as this Passion is subdu'd, in such measure is the Perfection of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>That Self-Love is the Poison of Divine Love, and the Mortification of this Love is the Perfection of the Love of God;</hi> for this is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect produc'd by this Cause, tho' this Mortification
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:154273:196"/> cannot be absolutely perfect in this Life; for (as the <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ame Saint says) <hi>Concupiscence may in this Life be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>rest, but not taken away.</hi> Hence this Holy Doctor <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oncludes, that the perfect Charity of this Life is <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hat which powerfully resists and puts from it all that cools and removes the Soul from this actual Love of God; that is, all Sin, and all other Impediments, which proceeding from Self-Love, take it off from the continual Exercise of this Love. So that, by how much more the Affection of Charity is inflam'd and united to God by actual Love, so much the more powerfully it resists all Foreign Loves, which takes it off from this Love; and so much will it be the more perfect, as being the more like to that of the blessed Inhabitants of Heaven, who ever, actually, and with all their strength, are inflam'd in the Love of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is the Rule that is given us for loving of God, and this is the Scope of the Precept which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, <hi>To love him with all our Heart, with all our Soul, and with all our Strength;</hi> not that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment can be perfectly fulfill'd in this Life, but to the end that hereby we might understand to what end all our Actions and Designs ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. To this purpose, the same Holy Doctor says, <hi>That the possible Perfection of Charity in this Life, is that Man use all his Industry and Care in loving of God, renouncing all Worldly Cares and Business, as far as the Duty of his Condition, or natural Necessities will permit.</hi> This is so apparent a Truth, that even the Heathen Philosophers, without the Light of Faith, discover'd it by the Strength of Reason. For one of them says thus; <hi>The beginning and end of a Perfect and Blessed Life, is a continual Regarding of God, and an interior Ʋnion, and serious Affection of our Mind towards him. Therefore the Soul being firmly rooted in him, will be nourished there, and obtain that Perfection for which it was created: But when it removes from thence, it will wither and decay, even as the Bough, which being cut off from the Tree, soon loses its Greenness and Beauty.</hi> All
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:154273:197"/> this was known to a Heathen Philosopher; whence you may gather how prevalent this Truth is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then according to this Doctrine, when a Man has arriv'd in this Mortal Life to such a degree of Love, as that despising all Transitory Things, he takes no Delight or Satisfaction in any of them, but fixes all his Pleasure, all his Love, all his Care, Wishes and Thoughts upon God, and that so continually, that his Heart may be always, or almost always fix'd upon him, as finding no Rest without him, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it only in him; when dying thus to all things, he shall live only to God, and through the Greatness of his Love, shall triumph over all other Loves; then has he entred into the Cellar of the Precious Wines of the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> where being inebriated with the Wine of this Love, he will forget all things, and even himself for him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I am not ignorant that there are but few who can rise to this pitch, and that Human Necessities, the Duties of Justice, and Charity it self sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires (if we may so term it) that we leave God for God: Yet this is propos'd, only to show the End we are to aim at, as much as in us lies; for tho' none can absolutely reach it, yet they who propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves greater things, and fly higher, shall approach nearer to it, than those that content themselves with a lower Station. To this purpose a wise Man says, <hi>In all good things we are to desire the highest degree, that at least we may obtain a Medium.</hi> From this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Desire St. <hi>Bernard</hi> said, <hi>Let my Soul die, O Lord, not only the Death of the Just, but the Death of Angels also;</hi> that is, that it be so dead and abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from all Worldly Things, as are not only the Just, but even the Angels, if it were possible. For a fierce and eager Desire does not regard its own Strength, proposes to it self no Bounds, is not govern'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and does not only wish for things possible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it regards not its own Capacity, but the thing it covets.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Mystical Divines call this Uniting Love, because the Nature of it is so to unite him that loves with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:154273:197"/> the lov'd Object, that he can find no rest from it, and therefore has always his Heart fix'd upon it. Such was the Love which the Holy Prophet figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively attributed to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> saying, <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 33.12.</note>
                     <hi>the best beloved of our Lord, shall dwell confidently in him, as in a Bride-chamber all the Day shall he abide, and between his Shoulders shall he rest.</hi> For it is the Property of Love, when vehement, to produce this Union; and the stronger the Love, the closer is the Union, as St. <hi>Dionisius</hi> says. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> expresses his Love to have been of this kind in many of his <hi>Psalms;</hi> for sometimes he says, <hi>His Soul always adher'd to God;</hi> otherwhiles, <hi>That he had always the Lord before him;</hi> and othertimes, <hi>That his Eyes were always fix'd on him.</hi> Such was also the Love of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> when he said, <hi>Lord, thy Name, and thy Remembrance is all the desire of my Soul. My Soul has desired thee in the Night, and to thee will I watch in the Morning with all my Spirit and Bowels.</hi> Such was the Love of the Blessed St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> of whom it is written, that at the beginning of his Conversion he was so wrapt in God, and had by that Means so lost the use of his Sences, that he knew not what he eat, or what he wore; where he was, or which way he went, his Spirit was so eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and united to God. For it is the natural Property of this Love (as has been said) to Unite the Heart of him that loves, and the Object lov'd; and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Union, is the Inestimable Sweetness and Delight flowing from the same Love, which so charms the Heart, that it can no way be parted from it, but takes a Distaste at all other Things. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is written of the Blessed St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> that all Worldly Affairs were nauseous to him, because of the great Sweetness he found in God, and in the Beauty of his House which he loved. Nor is this to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd at; for whoever with the Assistance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost comes once to be sensible of the great Beauty and Goodness of God, and of the Tenderness wherewith he treats his faithful Servants, will not look upon any of these things as incredible, because much more is to be expected from such Goodness,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:154273:198"/> such Charity, and such Generosity. Nor must any one presume to measure the Perfection of the Saints, or the Virtue of Charity, by his own Weakness and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, but by the Excellency of God, and by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it self: For if Parents, who have Children, say that none conceive or comprehend the Love of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but those who have them, tho' this be a thing natural and common; how can any know what the Supernatural Love of God is, but he that is inflam'd with this Love?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This Fundamental Point being made plain, it will be easie to understand how properly a Divine says, that it must be the Principal Study of the true Servant of God, to endeavour as much as in him is, to have his Soul ever united to God through Prayer, Contemplation, and Actual Love, which is the same thing, as we have hitherto explain'd. But because Means are to be us'd, and there must be, as it were, an ascending by Steps, to arrive at this Perfection, we will speak briefly of those Means and Steps in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part of this Treatise, which shall be divided into two Principal Branches. In the first we will Treat of the things that help us to obtain the Love of God, and of those that obstruct it: And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond we will set down some Prayers and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well upon the Divine Benefits, as Perfections, to stir up by these Means our Hearts to the Love of our Lord.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the Principal Means of obtaining the Love of God, which is a most Ardent Desire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. HAving already declar'd, that the true End of Christian Life consists in the Love of God, it is fit we now declare what Means are proper to be us'd for obtaining this Love, tho' it be better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in what manner God uses to impart it to Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souls, that thus Man may learn how he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and dispose himself to receive this Benefit at the Hand of God, performing what is in him, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jointly with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this Effect, in the first place it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that no Human Industry is of it self capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of obtaining this Virtue, because it is the free Act and Gift of God, and the chiefest of all his Gifts. Therefore the Apostle says,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note>
                     <hi>The Charity of God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it self into our Hearts, through the Holy Ghost that was given us.</hi> So that the Holy Ghost (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Three Divine Persons is essentially Love) is he who descends into the Soul of the just Man, and who influences and creates in him this Celestial Habit, which inclines and moves him to love God. Therefore as the same Holy Spirit, by means of the Habit of Faith, inclines our Understanding to believe all that God says; so this Habit of Charity inclines our Will (which was grown cold in his Love) to love him above all other things that can be belov'd. Men sought out Methods and Arts by certain Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Inchantments to produce Love where it was not, and this for the Destruction of Souls, and the intangling of them in Vice. Now, since that Divine Goodness and Providence is no less Careful and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to find out Inventions to do Good, than wicked Men are to do Evil; it is therefore no wonder, that God should create this Supernatural Habit in the Hearts of Men, to inflame them in the Love of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:154273:199"/> and Invisible Things, to which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grown cold.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is now to be observ'd, that the most usual and common Method our Lord takes to increase and perfect this Virtue in his Servants, is by giving them at first a new Relish and experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Dignity, Sweetness and Beauty of this Virtue, thereby to stir up in the Soul an earnest Desire of it, and to move it to labour as much as possible for it. This is in some measure like unto a Merchant, who has a rich Wine to sell; he first gives a Taste of it to the Buyer, that being sensible of its Excellency, he may the more readily give the full Price for it. This is also represented to us by the Marriage of <hi>Jacob</hi> with <hi>Rachel;</hi> he first saw her Beauty, that caus'd in him a vehement Desire to take her to Wife, and therefore he said to her Father, <hi>I will serve thee Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years for thy Daughter Rachel.</hi> And so great was his Love, that he thought this but little. To this Effect we read in the <hi>Canticles, If a Man give all he has for Charity, he will look upon it as nothing.</hi> Give ear then, dear Christian. This Wine and this <hi>Rachel</hi> is one and the same thing. For this Wine is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this <hi>Rachel</hi> is the Symbol of Divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which tends to Charity. This is the Wine which our Lord made of Water at the Wedding; the Wine to which the Spouse invites us to, saying, <hi>Drink, my Friends, and be drunk, ye much beloved.</hi> This is the Wine, lastly, that <hi>David</hi> spoke of. <hi>And my Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice inebriating, how goodly is it?</hi> Which last Word is not found in the Hebrew, where the <hi>Psalm</hi> only says, <hi>The Chalice which inebriates me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 22.5.</note> And there he breaks off abruptly, without adding any other Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he found no Words to express so much as he felt in his Heart; and therefore he, as it were, hid under a Shadow, what he could not expose in proper Colours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The first thing our Lord does with his Servants, when he will make them increase in this Virtue, is to give them a Taste of the Inestimable Sweetness of this Wine, that is, to infuse into them a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:154273:199"/> not Humane, but Divine; not Natural, but Supernatural; not Speculative, but Experimental; by which Man perceives the unspeakable Sweetness and Beauty of this Virtue, and is inform'd, that it is the Queen of all Virtues, and the Death of all Vice; that it lifts Man up to Heaven, and unites him with God, and makes him Partaker of the Heavenly Delights, to the end that being supported with Blessings of Sweetness, fed with this Food, and convinc'd of the Value of this Commodity, he may labour as much as possible to obtain it. So that our Lord gives this beforehand, and without any Labour, but he will have the rest purchas'd with Pain. So we read, that <hi>Jacob</hi> received <hi>Rachel</hi> to Wife, but then follow'd the Seven Years Service he was to do for her. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Merchant gives a Taste of his Wine <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> but the rest he sells at the full Rate.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>§. Of the Desire of Divine Love, and of what Nature it must be to obtain it.</head>
                     <p n="5">5. THE aforesaid Knowledge produces in the Soul a most Ardent Desire of this Virtue, which Desire is also a special Gift of God, as is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from whence it proceeds. There is scarce any Comparison that can so express the vehemency of this Desire in some Persons. Great is the Desire the Covetous Man has of Money, and the Ambitious Man of Honour, since they both ransack the World, and use all their Endeavours for the attaining those Ends, yet all is nothing when compar'd with this Desire; which as it is grounded on a nobler Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and aspires to a more lofty End, so is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater. This was the Desire of the Wise Man, when speaking of this Virtue, he said, <hi>This I have loved and sought from the beginning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take her for my Bride, being greatly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with her Beauty.</hi> Signifying by these Words, that as a Man who is desperately in Love with a young Virgin, neither Eats, nor Drinks, nor Sleeps, nor Rests, but is wholly taken up with that Thought,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:154273:200"/> and values no Trouble or Danger on that Account, and is fit for no other Business, because all his Senses are employ'd on his Love: So he who thus is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with the Love of that Heavenly Bride, which is Divine Wisdom and Charity, thinks of no other thing, values no other, desires no other, begs none so earnestly; nor is there any Trouble or Danger, which he will not undergo for obtaining of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Soul that is once Wounded with this Dart of Love, the Soul that Burns, and is Inflam'd with this Desire, having already receiv'd the First-Fruits of the Holy Ghost, and tasted with a pure and clean Palate, one drop of that Ineffable Sweetness and Goodness of God, this Soul can never find Rest, till it come to that Fountain of Living Water, whereof it has already tasted. Even as a Hound is heavy and dull before he has discovered his Game, but having got a Scent of it, grows restless, and runs about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceasing, till he find what he smelt; so the Soul, when it has once scented the Odour of that Infinite Sweetness, runs after the Smell of this Precious Ointment.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thus our Lord bids us seek, and promises we shall find: Saying; <hi>Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be open'd unto ye.</hi> Which words <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> thus interprets, <hi>Ask Praying,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 11.9.</note>
                        <hi>Seek Labouring, and Knock Desiring.</hi> For it is requisite the Desire of Heavenly Things be very great and ardent in us; to the end the greatness of the Desires may be suitable to the greatness of the Rewards. Our Lord will not have his Gifts become cheap, by the easiness of obtaining them. A Treasure so Precious, and so Worthy to be Coveted, deserves an eager Lover, and an eager Purchaser. So that the Bountiful Promiser of such Great Things, is not pleas'd with the Lukewarm, despises the Weak, admits not the Unwilling, and rejects the Indevout; because the Giver looks upon it as a Contempt, that Man should not be Thankful for his Benefits. Let us then, Dear Christians, Desire as much as we can, since we cannot as much as we ought. In another place in the same Homily, he recommends to us this
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:154273:200"/> Fervour and Desire: Saying; <hi>The ardent Desire of Obtaining, and the Custom of Improving, always raises us higher, and God, seeing our Devotion, will the more Inflame our Desire; and the more our Desire increases, the greater will be his Assistance; and the greater Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we use, the greater will be his Grace; according to that which is written; To him that has it shall be given, and he shall abound. And in another place; I have placed Help (says our Lord) in the Powerful; that is, I helped him that helped himself.</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, Grace springs from Grace, Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Improvement, and Profit from Profit: To the end, that the more a Man gets, the more he may take Heart, and delight in Getting; and the Profit of his Care may increase the Desire of Gain. Let him who thus Seeks, be assur'd that he shall Find. But he that shall not bear the Flower of this Desire, shall not produce this Sweet Fruit; as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> briefly express'd it in one of his Epistles: Saying; <hi>As Faith disposes towards true Knowledge, so the Desire disposes to perfect Love:</hi> And as the Prophet said; <hi>If ye Believe not, ye shall not Ʋnderstand:</hi> So also it may properly be said; If ye Desire not, ye shall not perfectly Love.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This Ardent Desire is the very Root of this Tree of Life, as the Wise Man plainly testifies: Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>The Source whence Divine Wisdom springs, is a most Ardent Desire of it:</hi> For this Desire carries Man to all the Means and Labours requisite for obtaining of Faith. For, (as a Learned Man says) <hi>Nothing is difficult or troublesom, to him that truly Desires.</hi> Such was the Desire of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when he swore and vow'd, <hi>That he would not enter into the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his House, nor take Rest upon his Bed, nor give Sleep to his Eyes, nor Rest to his Days; till he had found a Place for the Lord, and a Dwelling for the God of</hi> Jacob. This Noble Desire is the Beautiful Flower that produces this Heavenly Fruit: This is the Eve and Forerunner of this Feast; as the Wise Man plainly declares, in these Words; <hi>If thou seek Wisdom with the same eagerness that Men seek Money, and they that dig for Treasure, be assured thou wilt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:154273:201"/> find it.</hi> All this St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> expressed in few Words, thus; <hi>Only he has this Heavenly Gift, who receives it; only he receives, who desires it; and only he desires it, who is first Inflam'd by the Fire of the Holy Ghost, which Christ came to leave upon Earth.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. THE Desire (as has been said) is the Root, from which spring all the Branches of Virtue that are requisite for obtaining this so much sought-for Blessing. For the Impatience of the Desire suffers not the Heart to be at rest, but is always stirring it up, to use all possible Means to obtain what it aims at.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of continual Praying for, and Aspiring to the Love of GOD.</head>
                     <p n="2">2. BEcause Man knows, that this desir'd Good is in the Power of God, and that it is he who hides the Light in his Hand, and commands it to rise again, (as is written in the Book of <hi>Job:</hi>) And because he knows that one of the Principal Methods there, for Obtaining Benefits of our Lord, is Fervent Prayer, according to these Words of the Psalm; <hi>The Lord is near to those that call him, if they call him in Truth;</hi> that is, with sincere and inward Desire. Therefore Man, knowing this, is so earnest in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning God; that Day and Night, in the usual Times of Prayer, and out of them, and even amidst the Business he is employ'd in, he never ceases to Sigh like a Dove, and to Solicit the Heavenly Father for this Benefit. And he is so wholly taken up with it, that he has no Rest, either Eating, or Drinking, or Going: Nor does he cease to fill Heaven and Earth
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:154273:201"/> with his Cries, Weeping where-ever he hopes to find Relief; and particularly, Invoking the most Blessed Virgin, and all the Saints, to Favour his Request. He neither Reposes, or is Quiet, or thinks he Lives, whilst he wants this Treasure. In this Eagerness of Thought he presents himself before the Divine Majesty, with the Leper in the Gospel, saying;</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Lord, if it were thy Will, thou might'st Cleanse my Soul from all its Sins, with the Fire of thy Love. If it were thy Will, thou could'st suddenly Enrich the Poor Man: If it were thy Will, thou could'st make me the Happiest and Joyfulest Man in the World, with one single Spark of thy Love. Lord, what will it Cost thee, to do me so much Good? What Loss wilt thou sustain? What Damage will come to thee? Why then, my Lord, (since thou art an Abyss of Infinite Riches and Liberality) dost thou in thy Wrath detain thy Mercies from me? Why must my Wickedness prevail above thy Goodness? Why shall my Sins be more powerful to Damn me, than thy Mercy to Save me. If thou dost expect Sorrow and Satisfaction, I am so sorrowful for having Offended thee, that I would rather I had Dy'd a Thousand Deaths, than that I had sinn'd against thee. If thou expect Satisfaction, behold here is my Body, inflict on it all the Punishments of thy Wrath, so thou deny me not thy Love. May I then Love thee, my Lord and my God, my Strength, my Support, my Comfort, my Deliverer, my Helper, and my Hope. Thee alone I love, thee alone I covet, and thee, my Lord, I call upon; for thou alone art my Beginning and my End. Lord, the things of this World do not satisfie me, they have no Taste, no Continuance, nor no Being: All I see without thee is Poverty, all troubled and salt Waters, which do not quench, but rather increase the Thirst. Thee alone I love, in thee I delight, thy Sight I desire, thy Presence I will seek, turn not thy Face away from me, O Lord!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. With these and the like Clamours, which her earnest Desire suggests to the Soul, when dispos'd by
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:154273:202"/> this Love, she continually Solicits God; and with the Holy Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Importunate Friend in the Gospel, never ceases to call, to importune, and beg this Grace. It is a very convenient Method for a Man, to take upon himself the Spirit and Heart of poor Beggars, as was done by the Holy King <hi>David;</hi> who sometimes call'd himself an Orphan, sometimes a Sick Man, sometimes a Poor Forsaken Beggar; and thus with such an humble Heart to cry to God, and beg this Alms of him. Neither must he only imitate them in the Earnestness and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Begging alone, but in all the other Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances they use to this End. Observe how these Beggars are full of Sores, with Broken Limbs, Sickly, Hungry, enduring Heats and Colds, with all other Inconveniences by Day and by Night, seeking their Sustenance, and how patiently they wait all Day for a small Alms, which yet sometimes they obtain not. Now if all this be done and endur'd for a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Bread, what ought to be done for that Bread of Angels which maintains our Souls? Observe also how they endeavour to find out the properest Places to Beg, as Churches, and the most Charitable People; and thither they resort for Relief. So this Spiritual Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar seeks Solitude and Quiet, which is the most proper for Prayer, and to beg Alms of God; then he turns to the Saints, which are as it were the Houses of Merciful Rich Men, to ask their Assistance. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve also, how the Beggar, if he have any thing Good, conceals it, and discovers his Sores and Broken Limbs, to move such as can Relieve him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion: So the other does not in Prayer discover the Riches he possesses, (as did the proud Pharisee) but the Sores and Wounds of his Sins, like the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Publican, to move the Divine Mercy by the sight of his Misery. In short, as the Poor Beggar spends the whole Day from Morning till Night in Begging from Door to Door, laying hold of all Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may be for his Advantage; so the Spiritual Beggar labours all that in him is, that his Life may be a continual Prayer, and makes every thing a Motive
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:154273:202"/> to encrease his Desire, to persevere in his Request, and to lift up his Heart to God. When he beholds the Beauty of this World, and of all the Creatures in it; thence he gathers (as the Wise Man says) how much more Beautiful the Creator is that made them, and how much more Love and Admiration the sight of him must cause, and this moves him the more earnestly to beg of him this Love. If he sees any thing very Deformed, thence he inferrs there is no greater Deformity than that of the Soul which wants this Love; and therefore begs of our Lord, not to suffer it to be so Deformed. To be short, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that all things in Heaven, and upon Earth, are the Benefits of God, and Tokens of his Goodness and Perfection; and therefore imagines they all call upon him, and require of him the Love of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To this purpose it is convenient a Man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of certain short and devout Prayers, which he may always bear in the Mouth of his Soul, thereby to beg of our Lord this Love, and to inflame himself the more in it. For the Words of God are like Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to blow this Heavenly Fire; some of these shall be set down at the end of this Treatise. Yet those that flow from the Desire and Covetousness of this Grace are most convenient for this purpose; especially when the Desire is great. For, (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) <hi>Devotion is the Tongue of the Soul,</hi> and therefore when she is Devout she can plead her own Cause, and lay open her Wants before God. However, when the Soul is not devoutly dispos'd, this Method of Set Prayers is very proper, as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, who owns that to this Effect he writ the Manual, in which there are many of these Prayers. This then is the first Exercise which proceeds from this Holy Desire, which is greatly recommended by all that Treat of this Subject, as being one of the principal Means of obtaining the Perfection of this Virtue. For tho' there be other Methods of increasing it, yet it more especially is augmented by its own Acts, (that is, by the practice of Loving God) and that by so much the more, by how much they are the more Fervent
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:154273:203"/> and Passionate. For as a Nail is drove farther by one Smart Stroke, than by several Small Ones, so Charity is more increas'd by one Vehement and Generous Act, than by many that are Cool and Slack. These, tho' they might, by being multiply'd, increase Charity; yet on the other side, the Habit of them by degrees makes a Man Lukewarm and Negligent, which disposes him to lose even the Charity he has; a thing much to be fear'd and reflected upon. But because these Desires, and Fervent Prayers, whereof we speak, are either Acts of Charity, or nearly related to it; hence it is that they are so conducing to Advance in it, and that they are so much recommended by all Masters of this Mystical Divinity.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. THIS Devout Petitioner knows, that to the end his Prayer may be Devout and Attentive, it is requisite to lay aside the Multiplicity of unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Business, and to recollect the Sences, especially the Eyes and Ears, because these things overcharge the Spirit with the multitude of Cares, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Objects that make way into our Souls, through these Sences. Therefore he labours all that he can to shut himself up within himself, laying aside as much as possible, as Business that is not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary, and recollecting his Sences, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his Soul, that being thus United in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he may remain entire without Dividing, so to lift up his Heart in Purity to God, and to employ himself wholly in him. To this St. <hi>Anselm</hi> invites us: Saying; <hi>Go to then, miserable Man, fly a little from thy worldly Affairs, and hide thy self from thy restless Thoughts, cast from thee all heavy Cares, lay aside thy Labours and Distractions, and recollect thy Heart, that it may be employ'd in God, and rest in him. Fly from the Business of outward Works, hide thy self from the Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:154273:203"/> of thy Imaginations, cast away the Cares of thy Reason, lay aside the Distractions of thy Will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy Spirit to attend to God. But see thou dost this in such manner, that the Enemy may not Scoff at thy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; that is, at the rest of thy Contemplation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, observe thou art so to resign thy self up to God, that thou may'st not only see him with the Eyes of thy Understanding, but that thou may'st relish him with thy Will; for so doing, thou wilt easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise all things for him. For (as <hi>Ricardus</hi> says) <hi>None can have a loathing of Exterior Goods, unless he have tasted the Inward; neither can he relish the Inward, unless by degrees he quit the Exterior.</hi> Let the Devout Man then recollect his Heart from Exterior to the Inward things, and from the Inward to those that are more Lofty, to the end that all his Conversation and Correspondence may be with God, which is proper to those that aspire to the Supreme Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. HE also knows, that Prayers join'd with Fasting, Disciplines, and other Bodily Afflictions, are very powerful for obtaining any thing of God, as were those of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> on this same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as the Angel reveal'd it to him. For, (as a Religious Person fitly said) <hi>That is worth nothing, whicb costs nothing;</hi> and consequently, that which is worth much, must cost much. Neither is it for the Honour of God's Gifts, nor for the Security of Man, that the Blessing should be cheaply given, which is carefully to be kept. Therefore says <hi>Eusebius Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senus, He knows not how to preserve a Benefit, who knows not how to desire it; and the Gift is in danger, when it is not diligently sought.</hi> The Method and Order that God has appointed to all things, is, that there be a proportion betwixt the Cause and the Effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Means and the End, and betwixt the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:154273:204"/> Form and the Dispositions which are to precede. And since the End and the Form we aim at is excellent, because by means of the Love of God, we obtain God himself, what Labour, what Industry can be great, when compar'd to this End? Then let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry be suitable to the Grace, and the Labour to the Reward. Our Lord will not have his Gifts lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle valued; and therefore tho' sometimes he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to those that did not seek them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd those that slept, (as he did with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and some others) yet generally-speaking, he gives them not, but to those that seek them in Earnest, and none seeks them so, but he who seeks them with Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body and Spirit. And since the Grace which is begg'd, is not only for the Soul, but for the whole Man, is it reasonable that all Men labour for it, the Soul with earnest Desires, and the Body with Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; that so they may partake in the Labour, who are to partake in the Benefit?</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Now he that desires the Love of God, being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hereof, begins immediately to undertake all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Fasting, Hair-Cloaths, Disciplines, Watching, and other the like Austerities. And he takes such delight in them, that he is in the midst of Labours without any Trouble, and in Trouble without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; because he regards not the Labour, but the Fruit of it; nor the Trouble, but the Cause of it, which is the Love of God; which makes him va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his Sufferings as little, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his for the Love of <hi>Rachel.</hi>

                     <p n="9">9. IT is also to be understood, that the stress of all this Business consists in pleasing God, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Will. For, (as the Prophet says) <hi>The Eyes of our Lord are upon the Just, and his Ears upon their Prayers.</hi> For it is proper to our Lord to Love those that Love him, and to Fulfil the Will of those that
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:154273:204"/> Fulfil his. Consider then, that nothing is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to our Lord, and he recommends nothing to us more earnestly, than to relieve the Needy, attend the Sick, comfort the Afflicted, and to assist those that are in Want: Saying; <hi>It is he himself who receives this good turn; and that what is done for his sake, is done to him.</hi> When the Spiritual Man considers this, he extreamly Rejoices at the opportunity that is thus offer'd him, of coming at our Lord through his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and he looks upon it as a great Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that there are Poor upon Earth, since their Lord is in them; and through them he has the Means of Receiving and Entertaining him that is able to do him so much good. For this reason he serves not the Poor as Poor, nor looks on them as such, but Regards them as him they Represent, and Serves them with the same Diligence and Joy, as if they were his proper Person. For with the Eyes of Faith he looks not upon the Person of the Beggar, but upon the Word of him that said, <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p n="10">10. And tho' they that do this be themselves Poor, they are never Poor to do good, for the Desire they have to give makes them Rich, and so one way or other they always find something to give. For as we say, the Gamester never wants to Play, because his Desire makes him still find Money, so he that desires to do good, tho' never so Poor, never wants wherewithal to do it. And when he wants Money, or other Necessaries, his Person is not wanting; so that if he have not to Give, he can Serve and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which sometimes is no less valuable.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. THE Spiritual Man hears it said, that Likeness causes Love, and that one of the things which most pleases God, and makes Man most like to him, is to suffer Persecutions, Wrongs, Poverty, and other Troubles for his sake. Therefore he considering that all the Life of Christ was an Abyss of Sufferings, Pains, Poverty and Persecutions, is sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with so vehement a Desire of these things, that Worldly Men do not so much covet Riches and Pleasure, as he does to suffer for the sake of God: Thus we read of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that he was much more desirous of Pove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty, than any Covetous Man was of Riches. And of the Glorious St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that he desir'd Martyrdom as eagerly as the Deer does the Fountains of Water. And as if one Martyrdom were too little to satisfie his Desire, he wish'd a particular Matyrdom for every one of his Limbs, that so he might more perfectly imitate <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. I am sensible this Perfection is not common to all Men; but it is propos'd to all Men, to the end that such great Examples may at least encourage us to aim at lesser things. Especially considering, that by how much the more voluntarily we undertake Sufferings, by so much they will be the more easie to us to undergo. It is said of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> a fierce Creature, that it flies if assaulted, and pursues if you fly from it. It is even so with the Crosses and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this World; they fly, and cease to be Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to him, who for the Love of God, seeks and lays hold of them; but they Pursue and Torment him that flies from them, because the Pain consists not in the Burden of Suffering, but in the Reluctancy of the Will.</p>

Thus the true Servants of God use the things of this World, taking scarcely what is necessary, and that hastily, without staying for their fill; that their Souls may not adhere to the inordinate desire of them.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. HE also perceives, that because he resolves to Abandon the World, and Die to it; and because he will not Adore strange Gods, nor expect Relief from them; by reason he will not reap where he does not sow, nor receive where he does not give: Considering this, and observing on the other hand, that Human Life is subject to many Wants and Miseries, and that it stands in need of many Supports to maintain it, therefore he resolves to place all his Confidence and Hope in him; for whose sake he forsakes all things; believing he is so Good, so Just, and so Careful of his own People, (as the Scripture witnesses) that he alone is sufficient so Supply all his Wants. Doing thus, he does not believe he is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or left to seek, but thinks himself the more secure, seeing by these Means he has gain'd a more
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:154273:206"/> powerful Protector. He is much comforted herein by reading the Psalms, and other Books of Scripture; in which he perceives there is scarce a Chapter, wherein God does not promise Graces, Mercies, and Special Providences, to all those that hope in him; provided they do not cease to labour and do what in them is; because to do otherwise, were to tempt God. With this Support he is Rich amidst Poverty, Contented in Wants, Safe in Dangers, and Peaceable in Contradictions; saying with the Apostle, I know in whom I have confided, who is Powerful to secure the Trust I have repos'd in him. When there occurr to him Troubles and Difficulties, he lifts up his Eyes to the Mountains, whence his Relief is to come; because he knows that the Keeper of <hi>Israel</hi> does not sleep, nor forget; and therefore he sleeps secure, as knowing how diligent a Watch he has over him.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Thus, by Means of the Virtue of Hope, he obtains Inward Peace, which is the most proper Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position towards the Divine Union and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; because having his Confidence in God upon all Occasions, and believing that he will bring him out of all Difficulties, he has no Cause to be troubled or afflicted, or to stray over the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to gather Straws, and divert himself from the Divine Love. Wicked Men know nothing of this Peace, because they wanting this sort of Confidence in God, their Hearts are disturb'd and restless upon every little Occasion; because being setled upon Worldly Things, they are toss'd to and fro as those are.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of Self-Love.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THESE Things we have hitherto spoke of, do Assist us to Attain to the Perfection of the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:154273:206"/> Love of God. But it is not enough to seek after those things that Assist us, unless we also Labour to remove all those that Obstruct. Among these, the first and chiefest (from which all the others proceed) is Self-Love; that is, the Sensual and Inordinate Love we bear to our Body, the mortifying and subduing of which, is so necessary for the Obtaining of Divine Love, that we shall Obtain just so much of this Love, by how much we Subdue the other: As was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd at the beginning of this Treatise; where we said, That the perfect Mortification and Subduing of Concupiscence, appertains to the Perfection of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this Life: For Concupiscence is the same Love, which (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says) is the Poison of Charity; and therefore he that would advance in the Love of GOD, must always be at War with Self-Love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are many Reasons for this, and it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to understand them, that we may the more plainly perceive the Consequence of it. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it is requisite we be convinc'd, that (as a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher says) <hi>He who truly loves, can perfectly love but one Object:</hi> Because the Capacity of Man's Heart is so small, that when employ'd upon one thing, it has scarce room left for another. So that as one piece of Ground cannot well bear several sorts of Seeds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so neither can one Heart contain several Loves; especially when they are opposite to one another. Now what can be more opposite than the Love of God, and Self-Love? For Self-Love will have all for it self, contrives all for it self, and makes it self its ultimate End. On the other side, the Love of God contrives all things for God, and denies and crucifies it self. Now as these are contrary Ends, so are all other Affections and Acts that proceed from hence, and therefore it is impossible they should both be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in one Heart. For how can the Love of God, and the Love of the World agree together? The Love of the Earth, and the Love of Heaven? The Love of the Flesh, and Spiritual Love? Self-Love, and Divine Love? How can Truth and Vanity be united, things Temporal and Eternal, things Supream
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:154273:207"/> with the Base, things Sweet with the Bitter, things of Peace with the Turbulent, and things Spiritual with the Carnal? Therefore St. <hi>John Climacus</hi> fitly said, <hi>That as it is impossible with the same Eye at once to look upon Heaven and Earth, so it is to love the Heavenly and Earthly things with the same Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some of the Antient Phisophers were very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this Truth, and the better to express it, they imagin'd the World to be divided into Two equal Parts; in one of these they plac'd the Things Eternal, and in the other the Temporal; in the midst of these they plac'd Man, as it were in the Horizon; that is, betwixt Time and Eternity. For in as much as he has a Corruptible Body, he belongs to the Temporal Things; and as he has an Incorruptible Soul, he belongs to the Eternal. Now according to this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, they said, that as he who is upon this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere, cannot see what is in the other; nor they in the other cannot see what is in this: So he that is within this Hemisphere of Time, cannot see into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and he who is wholly taken up with Eternity, cannot observe Temporal Things. Hence it is, that Spiritual Men are so taken up with God, that they forget the World. And on the other side, Sensual Men are so involv'd in the Affairs of the World, that they do not remember God, because these are in the Hemisphere of Time, and the others in that of Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now our Soul being plac'd betwixt these so different Extreams, as are Time and Eternity, the Creator and the Creatures; St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>That by converting it to the Creator, it becomes enlightned and edified in him; but converting it to the Creatures, it is darkned, sullied, and decay'd with them.</hi> This the Holy Doctor imagin'd, that even as a thing that is plac'd betwixt Musk and Mud, if it adhere to Musk will smell of the Musk, and if it cleave to the Mud will scent of the Mud: So the Soul, which is plac'd betwixt God and the Creatures, becomes like unto the Party to which it joins it self: Which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle confirms, saying, <hi>He that cleaveth to a leud Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:154273:207"/> becomes one Body with her; But he that cleaveth to God, becomes one Spirit with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. But this Self-Love does not only obstruct the Love of God in this manner, (that is, as their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Ends are so opposite) but several other ways also. For besides that, this Love is the General Cause of all Sin, and Obstruction of Virtue, (two Evils so great, and so opposite to the Love of God) it also obstructs, because it takes up all the Time in seeking what is pleasing and profitable to the Body. For as the Birds, Fish, and Brute Beasts, spend their whole Life in seeking their Sustenance; as having no Capacity beyond that; so those who are Self-Lovers, making no account of another Life, but of this alone, value nothing but what belongs to it, and are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently employ'd in nothing else. For this Reason, they always want time for those Exercises which the Love of God requires; which are Reading, Prayer, Meditation, Confessing, Receiving, and Attending to all things that Charity requires.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It obstructs no less by Means of the Solicitude and Cares, which these same Employments bring along with them. For no Business or Satisfaction is compass'd without some Care, which afflicts and wracks the Soul; and by this Means loses the Peace, Liberty, and Purity of the Heart; which is the sweet and soft Bed whereon the true <hi>Solomon</hi> reposes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Thus Weeds hinder the growth of good Plants, choaking them that they may not thrive: As our Saviour represents it in the Parable of the Man that Sow'd; where he says, <hi>That the good Seed which fell among Briars, no sooner sprung up, but the Briars choaked it: And these, he says, are the Temporal Cares which this vile Love brings along with it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. It also obstructs with its Delicacy: For the great Lovers of Themselves are very Dainty, and addicted to Pleasure and Delight: For tho' they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly by Word of Mouth commend the Sentence of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> (who placed all Felicity in Delight) yet they praise it by their Actions, spending their whole Life in Pleasure. For this Reason, they always seek
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:154273:208"/> some Diversion of Musick, Hunting, Feasting, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing, Laughing, and the like: They hate Solitude, fly Privacy, love their Belly, hate Crosses, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure Silence, Reading, and Prayer least of all. What Disposition are they in, to undertake the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses requir'd by the Love of God, whose Hearts are so taken up? For this is not an Undertaking for frail and effeminate Hearts, but for high Spirits, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courages. That strong Woman, so much commended by <hi>Solomon,</hi> stretch'd out her Hand to strong things, and girt her Loins with Fortitude, and strengthned her Arms for to Labour. But Self-Love on the contrary, refuses to put on Armour, to grasp the Buckler, and to encounter with Sufferings. In short, there is nothing more opposite than the Love of Ease, and the Love of Labour. And since the Love of God is obtain'd by Labour, how can he obtain it, who spends his Life in Pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The true Servant of God, who rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands this Doctrine, immediately prepares, takes up the Weapons against Himself, and Lists Himself under that Standard, and that Noble Commander, who says, <hi>If any one will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me.</hi> And if thou wilt know what Cross this is, it is no other but that the Apostle speaks of, saying, <hi>Those who are of Christ, have Crucifi'd their Flesh, with all its Vices and Appetites.</hi> Nor is it any thing else to deny one's Self, but to contradict all our Evil Affections, Inclinations, and Desires, when they are opposite to the Will of God; for this is to deny, and to be opposite to our Selves, that we may be conformable to GOD.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of the Mortification of our Will.</head>
                     <p n="9">9. THE Second and a great Obstruction to Charity, is our Sensual Will, which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> says, is the Source of all Sin; and that is the greatest
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:154273:208"/> Opposite to Charity. Besides, the Divine Will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fulfill'd, unless we renounce the Human, which is contrary to it. The Lover of God being sensible of this, resolves to become a Spiritual <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene;</hi> which signifies, a Man Dedicated to God: And this not for any limited Time, but for all his Life; that from thenceforward he may no more live to himself, but to God; nor regard himself, but God; which is that Spiritual Death so often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apostle, bidding us to be dead to the World, and to live only to God. A Type of this, were those Sacrifices in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> called Holocausts; in which the whole Beast was burnt, and offer'd up to God. Such are all those, who have so Consecrated their Souls, Bodies, and Wills to God, that they have reserv'd nothing for themselves, having resign'd all up to the Creator. So that as a Chalice, or other Holy Vessels, being Consecrated, must not be put to Prophane Uses: So he desires to be wholly Dedicated to God, that he may not be diverted by any other Business that may draw him from him. Therefore he resolves to be no more his own Man, nor Any-bodies, but God's; nor to seek Himself any more, but Him; nor to regard any longer either his own Will, or his Appetite, or his Satisfaction, or the Opinion of the World; but only to have respect to the Good Will and Pleasure of God: Thinking it a sort of Spiritual Theft, to employ himself in any thing that is not for him; since he has already Renounc'd himself, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated himself to him.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If any one imagine, we here require too much, and that this Doctrine is too profound, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, we are now come to the end of our Journey, and that we here speak of a Perfect Life, which may well attain to this Degree. Therefore none ought to complain, that we Show the Way, since we do not Oblige them to Travel it.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="section">

                     <head>§. <hi>III.</hi> Of the Avoiding all Sorts of SIN.</head>
                     <p n="11">11. THE Reason why we so much condemn Self-Love, and Self-Will, is, because they are the Roots and Sources of all Sin; therefore we must much more abhor Sin it self, than the Causes of it, which in themselves would not be contemptible, but for these Evil Effects which they produce. Now according to this Doctrine, let him that seeks for the Love of God, remember that it is written, Ye that Love God, Hate Sin; for there is nothing more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to this Love, than Sin. For if it be Mortal, it totally extinguishes Charity; and if Venial, it extinguishes the Fervor of it, and disposes towards quenching it. The one is like Death; the other like Sickness, that disposes for Death. The one is like setting Fire to the Tree; the other like keeping it from Water; by which Means it withers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unfit to bear Fruit.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Moreover, it is to be consider'd, that he who seeks the Love of God, designs to make his Soul the Habitation and Seat of God; and we know that to the House of God belongs Sanctity, and that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Justice are the Attendants of the Seat of God, according to the Saying of the Prophet. Now what is Sanctity, but Purity of Conscience? And what is Judgment and Justice, but for a Man dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to Examine his Life, and watchfully to Guard his Soul, that he may commit nothing contrary to the Laws of Justice? This then is the chief Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Habitation and Seat of God; for, (as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> says) <hi>So pure a Lord, must be lodg'd in a pure House.</hi> Let it be all our Care then, ever to preserve this Purity. So we read of a Holy Soul, who was so careful in this particular, that he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this Word, <hi>Purity, Purity:</hi> As well knowing, that it is written, <hi>Blessed are the clean of Heart, for they shall see the Lord.</hi> Man must always keep a
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:154273:209"/> most Watchful Eye to observe every step his Soul makes, that it may not be defil'd. I say always, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are many who make an attempt for some short time, and presently fall off; these at some Seasons Observe themselves, but do not continue their Vigilance. For as there is much difficulty in this Care, so it requires a particular Study and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. To this purpose, tho' a Man ought generally to Watch, and Observe himself on all sides, and to move with a Holy Fear and Solicitude, (as one that is amidst his Enemies) yet he is more particularly to Guard his Heart and his Tongue; that is, his Thoughts and Words; because these are the two principal Inlets to all sorts of Sins; and he who well Secures them, will Preserve his Soul very Pure. Of one of these <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>Keep a strict Guard upon thy Heart, because from it proceeds Life.</hi> Of the other in another place he says, <hi>He who Guards his Mouth, and his Tongue, Guards his Soul from Anguish.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. BY what has been said, it plainly appears, That the two principal Causes whence this Union of Love proceeds, are Prayer and Mortification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mortification puts from Man, all that is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to God, and Prayer unites Man to God; so that he becomes like to him. For as the principal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Converting Iron into Fire, is to apply it to the Fire, so one of the principal Means to Transform Man into God, by participation of his Spirit, is to keep his Heart always united to him. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, special mention is made in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> of these two Vertues, because these are they that principally raise up a Man to this Dignity. Which the very Angels admiring, put the Question, saying, <hi>Who is this that Ascends from the Desart like a Pillar of Smoak, which proceeds from Myrrh, Frankincense, and all other
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:154273:210"/> Sweet Pouders.</hi> Here by mentioning all Sweet Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are signify'd all the Virtues which are requisit<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> for this Ascending; but by making particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Myrrh and Frankincense, (which denote Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Prayer) it is signify'd, that these two Virtues do more especially Contribute towards this Transformation; for the one destroys all that is in Man Opposite to God; and the other by Uniting him to God, makes him the same Spirit with him. Therefore Man must Exercise these Virtues jointly, always begging his Grace of our Lord, and Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obtain this Conquest; because it is not enough to ask, unless we Labour, nor can we persevere in Labour unless we ask.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Now to Sum up all that has been said, we may in some manner compare the whole progress of this Ascending to a perfect Tree, whose Root is that first Taste and Experimental Knowledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Sweetness and Beauty of God's Love, and of God himself, because this Knowledge is the Source of all the rest. The Body of the Tree ascending from this Root, is that most ardent Desire, and vehement Care of obtaining this great Good. The Boughs are all the other aforementioned Virtues, which spring from this Desire. But the Fruit is the Perfection of Charity, and the Divine Union, which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all the rest. This manner of Procession is plainly shew'd in the Book of Wisdom; first grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Wisdom this Book Treats of, is the same Charity whereof we here speak, only with this difference, that Charity chiefly implies an Act of the Will, and presupposes the Act of the Understanding, but this Wisdom signifies an Act of the Understanding, accompany'd with the Love and Good-liking of the Will.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Observe how this Wise Man begins in the Sixth and Seventh Chapters, to extol Wisdom, and to speak Wonders of it, to the end by this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to excite us to the Desire of so excellent a thing. And therefore he says, that by this Means a most vehement Desire thereof was kindled in his Heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:154273:210"/> that he breaks out into these words,<note place="margin">Wisd. 8.2.</note> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wisdom; <hi>Her have I Loved, and have sought her out from my Youth; I have sought to take her to my Spouse, and I was made a Lover of her Beauty.</hi> And in another place;<note place="margin">Wis. 7.10.</note>
                        <hi>Above Health and Beauty did I Love her, and purpos'd to have her for Light, because her Light cannot be Extinguish'd.</hi> Behold how he magnifies the earnestness of his Desire of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. From this Desire flow'd that Diligence he us'd in Searching after it, employing all Means that might be conducing to that End. Therefore he presently after adds; <hi>Thinking these things with my self,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wisd. 18.17, 18.</note>
                        <hi>and recording in my Heart, I went about seeking, that I might take her to me.</hi> Observe how he says, <hi>I went about,</hi> to express the Care and Solicitude of his Search, and the divers Means he us'd to seek her; to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that as those who have laid Siege to some great Place of Strength, go about it to Discover which way they may best Break in; so the Soul that is desirous of this Blessing, is always Anxious and Solicitous, considering by what Means she may Obtain it.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And because among all these Means, Prayer is one of the chiefest, (by reason that this being a Gift of God, must most especially be obtain'd in this manner) therefore he presently betakes himself to this Exercise, and begins, saying,<note place="margin">Wisd. 9.1, 4, 6.</note>
                        <hi>God of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Lord of Mercy, give me Wisdom, the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of thy Seat; because if one be Perfect among the Children of Men, and thy Wisdom be absent from him, he shall be counted for nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. He more plainly join'd his Desire and Prayer, when he said, <hi>I Wished, and Sence was given to me; I Prayed, and the Spirit of Wisdom came upon me,</hi> &amp;c. Observe how the Desire sprung from the Knowledge, and from the Desire, the Prayer, and all other Means that serve to obtain this Virtue. These are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts of this Tree of Life; and these the Steps that lead to the Perfection of Charity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OVER and above what has been said, it will be necessary to furnish certain important In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for such as are to Tread this Path; among which let the first be, that the Wise Merchant of the Gospel, who seeks this precious Pearl with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to give all that shall be ask'd for it; be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that all he is worth is not enough, unless he be specially assisted by the Divine Grace and Mercy. Every Man must understand, that our Lord alone is he who distributes these Blessings, and bestows these Riches: It is he who hides the Light in his Hand, and again Commands it to shine out when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; therefore all his hope must be in him, since this Gift is wholly his. He is also to understand, that as all the Light of the Moon proceeds from the Sun, in such manner, that when he looks on her, she is Bright, and when he withdraws his Beams, she is Darkned: So all the Spiritual Brightness and Beauty of our Soul proceeds from God, in such manner, that whensoever he shall cease to look on her, she will cease to be. Witness <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> both most Holy Men, one of whom, as soon as this Sun of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice turn'd his Eyes a little from him, took another Man's Wife; and the other Ador'd Strange Gods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let Man therefore understand that which the Holy Scriptures so often inculcate, to wit, that as the Clay is in the Hands of the Potter, even so are we in the Hands of God. Therefore it is requisite we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves under his powerful Hand, that he may lift us up in the Day of his Visitation. Let us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cast our selves at his Feet, let us acknowledge our Poverty, let us understand that we are conceiv'd in Sin, that of our selves we are unfit for all that is
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:154273:211"/> Good, that we are the Children of Naked Parents, and that this Lord is he who can, if he pleases, easily Cloath and Enrich the Poor. This humble Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our selves, is the beginning and ground of Humility, and Humility is the Foundation of all Virtues, and more especially of Charity. Generally all the Waters of the Mountains run down into the Valleys, and all Divine Graces to humble Hearts; for as the Apostle says, <hi>God resists the Proud, and gives his Grace to the Humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore let Man, desponding of himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all his Spirit, all his Thoughts, and all his Hopes to God; let him Rely upon him, Confide in him, Call upon him, Rest in him, Importune him, Glory in him, and lay the Foundation of his Building up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this secure Rock. <hi>Who is there among you</hi> (says the Prophet) <hi>who fears God, and hears the Voice of his Servant? Who is there that walked in Darkness, and has not Light to go in? Whosoever he is (if he desires relief) let him hope in the Name of the Lord, and rely upon his God.</hi> Upon this solid Pillar Man is to repose his Trust, and not upon the broken Reed of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> that is, the Power and Strength of the Flesh.</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> The Second Instruction of the Fear of God.</head>
                     <p n="4">4. THIS Humility and Confidence must be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Holy Fear, which is to proceed from this principle; to wit, the Consideration of Man's Nakedness, his Misery, his Poverty, his Weakness and Instability, and the Dependence he must have on God, if he desires not to fall. For this reason the Apostle said, <hi>Work your Salvation with Fear and Trembling, remembring, that as well the Beginning as the End de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Will of God.</hi> As if he had more plainly said, Walk always Trembling and Observing, lest you Offend the Eyes of that Lord on whom you have all your Dependence, since all your Happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in him. Consider what a Man would think, if
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:154273:212"/> another held him hanging by a Rope from a high Tower, under which were some terrible Precipice; consider how fearful he would be, how courteous and obedient to him that held him, and how far from doing or saying any thing that might offend him. Just so Man ought to look upon God, who holds him as it were by a Thread; that is, by his Fatherly Providence. In such Awe is he to stand, for fear of offending in his fight, who can do him so much Good, or so much Harm, if he turns his Eyes from him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And this Fear must not only attend the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Actions of his Life, but also his Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises; in which the more devout he finds himself, and the more he is favour'd by our Lord, so much is he to be the more humble, more diffident, more bashful, and more fearful; reflecting on the Majesty of Him in whose presence he stands, and with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses: Imitating the Devotion of the Blessed St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who (as he himself says) had learnt to Rejoice in the Presence of GOD with Trembling.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. ABOVE all, it is very necessary that a great Regard be had to the Intention, in these Holy Exercises. Because our Lord sometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting his Servants with Extraordinary Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and giving them an abundant Relish of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Sweetness; hence it comes to pass, that Self-Love (which naturally seeks all Delight) being entic'd by the Taste of this Heavenly Food, does all that it thinks necessary for obtaining it; seeking therein nothing but its own Content and Satisfaction, as it would do in any other Affair where it found so much D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ause seeing his Exterior Good Work, he thinks the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Intention is answerable to it; and it proves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, because Self-Love is naturally very subtle, and easily slips in any where, without being perceiv'd.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The true Lover of God ought to be very jealous in this Point, strengthning his good Intention, and endeavouring to seek God purely for the sake of God, with the greatest Sincerity and Truth he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly can: And let him be assur'd, That the most certain Token we have that we shall find him, is when we seek him after this manner. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in these Words, <hi>If we would not seek our Lord in vain, let us seek him in earnest; let us seek him with perseverance, and let us not seek another thing through him, or with him, nor leave him for any other thing. By this Means it will be easier for Heaven and Earth to fail, than for him not to find who thus seeks, for him not to receive who thus asks, for the Gates not to be open'd to him that thus knocks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. If thou would'st more particularly understand the Intention and the End, thou should'st aim at in these Exercises: The End is, to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, to fulfil the Will of God, to deny thy own Will, to banish Self-Love, to mortify the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Appetites, to increase in the Exercise of Virtue, to endeavour to Labour more than others, and to be
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:154273:213"/> in thy own Esteem less than all others; and in short, (since all the Danger is in Self-Love) to oppose this Love in every thing, and to make use of all Divine Favours and Consolations to this purpose: And thus it will be lawful and good to desire and strive for these Consolations; otherwise it will be dangerous, as has been already declar'd.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Nevertheless, he that would make the true use of these Consolations, must be as well dispos'd to want, as to enjoy them; humbly resigning himself up to our Lord, and receiving of him whatsoever he is pleas'd to bestow with Thanksgiving: For he loves us more than we love our selves, and knows better what is convenient for us than we do our selves, and has more mind to give than we have to receive. This is one of the most material Points to be observ'd in this Doctrine.</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>IV.</hi> The Fourth Instruction, of Discretion in these Exercises.</head>
                     <p n="10">10. IT is also necessary to use Discretion and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as well in the Rigor of Corporal Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as in the Practice of Spiritual Exercises. For there are some, on whom our Lord very bountifully bestows his Gifts, who having once tasted this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sweetness, do so entirely devote themselves to it, and to all the Exercises and Means by which it is obtain'd, that they often forget to eat their Bread; I mean, to support Natural Frailty, and to take the necessary Sleep and Sustenance. Thus by degrees they destroy their Health, and are reduc'd to such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they are no longer fit to endure any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. These Persons must use this Moderation and Discretion, to the end they may so make use of God's Benefits, that they do not expose themselves to tempt God; expecting he should miraculously support that which they might maintain by other lawful Means. Those who go to Sea are not only in danger by Storms,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:154273:213"/> but even sometimes by Calms, when they last too long; so their Prosperity may cause many to fall, unless they know how to use it with Discretion. Fervor of Spirit, and Diligence, whence all Good Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, are very commendable; but Excess in any thing is dangerous. Let a Man therefore eat of this Bread with Temperance, and drink of this Heavenly Fountain by Measure; considering, that there may be a sort of Gluttony and Excess, as well in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as the Temporal Food. This is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of those to whom this Grace is given abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; not of those who receive it by piecemeal, and as it were drop by drop.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. This Discretion is not only necessary for this Purpose, but also upon several other Accounts; and particularly, that a Man may the better, as far in him lies, conceal his Virtuous Exercises and Intentions. <hi>Let him</hi> (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> says) <hi>rather strive diligently to conceal his Virtues, than his Vices; either for fear of Vain-glory, which is very natural, hurtful, and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; or else to shun the Censures and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the World, which was ever an Enemy to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and seems now to be in such a Condition, that either it would desire there were no Virtue at all; or that if any were, it might not be seen, because the very sight of it is become offensive.</hi>

                     <head>§. <hi>V.</hi> The Fifth Instruction of Stedfastness, and Perseverance in Pious Exercises.</head>
                     <p n="12">12. LET the last Instruction be concerning the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance that is requisite in these Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, for attaining the End we desire. Here we aim at Two Things, the most Difficult and Supernatural in the World. The one is, to banish from our Soul Self-Love, with all its Consequences. The other is, to introduce the Divine Love; that is, to destroy the Kingdom of Original Sin, in which Man is Born, and to substitute the Kingdom of God, which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:154273:214"/> is Forein. This is Attacking of Corrupt Nature, which is the most unconquerable thing in the World. For the Force of Natural Inclination is so great, that tho' thou forcibly cast it from thee, it will immediately return: Its Roots are fixt in our very Being, and therefore tho' all the Branches be cut off, it sprouts out again. It is like a hungry and greedy Dog, who tho' beaten out of the House at one Door, comes in again at the other. We see that a hard Stone, which when its natural Coldness is expell'd in the Fire, becomes Lime, being changed into another different Nature, and having lost its Name, together with its Species; yet being moulded with a little Sand, it soon returns to its former Hardness, and to its first Nature; to show how prevalent Nature is in all things. The nature of Self-love is no less powerful, but is rather the chiefest and strongest of our Inclinations; and therefore great Care, and much Grace, is requir'd to overcome it.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Yet there is nothing so difficult in the World, which a stedfast Perseverance, with Divine Grace, cannot compass. What great Structures are finish'd by degrees, laying one Stone upon another? What Way is there so long, but that the End of it is attain'd step by step? The Stone-Cutter, who hews a great Bason out of a solid piece of Marble, tho' at every stroke of the Chizzel he fetch out but a small Piece, yet after some Days continuance he brings his Work to Perfection. Now if Perseverance without Grace is so powerful, what will not it do when assisted by Grace?</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Let Man therefore persevere in this Glorious Undertaking, let him always continue his Good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and Exercises, whether he feel Devotion, or not; for after a few Days he shall Reap the Fruit of his Labours, and recover Strength to persist in them. And let him understand, That as it is easier to Comb the Hair every Day, when the Comb runs through without difficulty, than to do it after a long time, when it rather tears than combs the Hair: So it is easier to continue in Good Exercises, than to intermit
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:154273:214"/> them: For when the Heart of Man is once us'd to be Devout, and employ'd upon God, this Custom by degrees becomes almost Nature, and that which before was difficult grows easie. And if Business, Sickness, or Decay of Spirit, Molest and Divert him from this Course, let him as soon as that Distraction is past, return to the place from whence he stray'd, and not be discourag'd at any Contradictions that may happen to him, remembring he is to deal with that Lord, who is an Abyss of Goodness, who very well knows our Weakness, and who cannot deny himself to those who seek him, tho' they oft lose sight of him.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the principal Signs whereby to know we Improve.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THUS much may suffice by way of Instruction for those that aim at the Perfection of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho' the Subject is so copious, that much more might be said, but that the Title and Brevity of a Memorial will not permit. Now if any one who has undertaken this Task, be desirous to know whether he Improves; the principal Tokens or Marks of such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, which we can here assign, to omit many others, are Four. The First is, if he is so pleas'd and delighted with those things that are of God, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with conversing with him) that not only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Time and Exercise of Prayer, but at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Times and Occasions, his Heart is for the most part fix'd upon him, with an humble and loving At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in such sort, that he is dissatisfy'd and restless, when drawn away from this Retirement. For such is the property of this Love, which is call'd Unitive, as has been declar'd above. Such was the Love of that Virgin, of whom the Church Sings, that she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceas'd from Prayer, and Conversing with God, Day or Night.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:154273:215"/>2. The Second sign is, a fervent and earnest desire of Afflicting and Subduing the Flesh with Fasting, Watching, Hair-Cloth, Disciplines, and other Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, for the Love of God. For this is a Token that Divine Love now prevails against Self-love, whence springs this Desire of Afflicting the Flesh, which for the most part Self-lovers want, because they cannot resolve to misuse that which they Love. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side we see that all the Saints in general made much use of these Rigors and Austerities, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd their Bodies, at least those who had Age and Strength so to do, as being so far from Self-love, that they were arriv'd at the Holy Hatred of themselves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third sign is, a great Affection and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards our Neighbours, and a great Care and Diligence in Relieving and Assisting them in their Troubles, with sincere Love, with a perfect and holy Will and with Words and Actions different from what pass betwixt other Men; in such manner, that he who sees it may probably say with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, <hi>The Finger of God is here.</hi> For this sort of Will and Usage is not found among Men, nor is it proper to Flesh and Blood, but to the Spirit of God, whose Odour is here to be perceiv'd. It is plain that this is a sign of perfect Charity, because the Love of God cannot encrease without an Addition to that of our Neighbour, by reason they are both Acts of one and the same Habit; like two Branches that spring from the same Root, whereof, if the Root growing the one grows, the other must also of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity grow; and if it be thus grown, the growth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of being discover'd in some measure by the Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Fourth sign is, an earnest Desire of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poverty, Troubles, Persecutions, and Scorn, for the Love of God, and even of shedding Blood for him. For whereas there are several Degrees in Charity, some higher, and some lower; that seems to be the highest which joyfully quits Honour, Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for the Love of God; because these three being the principal Objects of Self-love, when a Man comes
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:154273:215"/> once not only to bear the Loss of them with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but also earnestly to Desire it; it is a sign that Self-love is quite Vanquish'd, and that the Love of God Reigns Absolute, since the Idols of Self-love are thus cast down, and trampled upon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. These Four are the principal Signs of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Purity of Charity; which many discover in themselves at the very beginning of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and these are such as are mercifully prevented by our Lord with abundance of Tears, and Blessings of Heavenly Sweetness, which confer on them these and many other Benefits. However, there are but few who know how to secure this Treasure, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing faithfully until the End as they Began. For very often after these happy Beginnings they grow slack in their Virtuous Exercises, either through Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or through some Secret Pride, or else by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting themselves with over-much Business, by which they stifle the Spirit; or sometimes by long Sickness, after which they do not return to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises with the usual Fervor, and other times by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting themselves Indiscreetly and Excessively to the Ambition of Learning, so that they quit the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Devotion; wherefore it is not to be admir'd if their Hearts faint, since they forget to give them their Food. Let him therefore that has arriv'd at that pitch, always bear in his Mind those words of St. <hi>John,</hi> when he says, <hi>Hold what thou hast, that thy Crown may not be given to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They who perform this, will Daily increase in Virtue, till they attain to Perfection; where they will enjoy those Treasures which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear heard, nor have they ascended into the Heart of Man. But those who do not so, besides losing what they have receiv'd, fall back into a continual Barrenness of Spirit; they weep when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they lost, and when they would return to it, they cannot find the way; for this is the just Judgment of God on those who knew not how to make the most of his Benefits; and there are many, who, after all these Graces, fall back into greater Evils,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:154273:216"/> which is a dismal sign of Reprobation, according to those words of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 26.27.</note> saying, <hi>And he that Transgresseth from Justice to Sin, God hath prepared him to the Sword.</hi>

HAVING thus prepar'd the Mansion, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd the Conscience with the aforesaid Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Exercises, it will be convenient to lift up our Hearts to God by the help of some Holy Prayers and Meditations, which may stir up and excite his Love in us. Because he being a Burning Fire, it is certain, that the nearer we approach to him, the more he will Consume the Rust of our Vices, and the more he will Inflame us in his Love. For if our Natural Fire does so freely Communicate its Heat to whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever approaches to it, as being the Noblest and most Active of the Elements, how much more ought we to expect it from that Lord, who, as he is infinitely more Noble, so is he also more Communicative of himself, and of his Gifts?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Holy Men do point out two Ways of attaining this End. The one they call Scholastical, which is to Meditate upon all those things which may kindle the Love of him in our Hearts, as particularly his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Perfections, because each of these Invites us to Love a Lord so worthy to be Belov'd, and from whom we have receiv'd such Benefits. The other is call'd Mystical, which is to beg of our Lord this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:154273:216"/> Gift with ardent Prayer, and earnest Desires, as was said above; for in reality this is his Gift, and the greatest of his Gifts, which he alone can give; and very freely gives it to such as ask it, with the Earnestness and Perseverance that so great a Good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves. For it is certain he will never be wanting on his part, unless there want some to ask as they ought. These two Methods Man is to make use of, to obtain his Request; but chiefly of the second, because it is shorter, and more efficacious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And because all Capacities know not either how to Meditate on these things, or how to ask these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits as they ought, therefore here are set down some Meditations, as well upon God's Benefits bestowed on us, as upon his Divine Perfections, and some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and Fervent Prayers, which may be us'd (at least while they are Beginners) by those who desire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in this Virtue. For after they have made use of them, Time, and Experience, and the Holy Ghost, who is the true Master of this Doctrine, will teach them better what they are to do. For tho' these Prayers and Meditations, here set down, be proper for many Times and Occasions, yet very often this is perform'd with more Fervor and Devotion, when it only proceeds from the Heart, in such Terms as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion suggests. And this being the Ground of all, Man must use those Means that he finds the most Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious. It is sometimes a good Method to begin the Exercise with these Written Prayers and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when the Heart is somewhat mov'd, to go on with what it produces of it self, as shall be most agreeable, provided that the Prayers it sends forth be like Sparks of Fire, issuing from that vehement Desire we spoke of above.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Here follows a Devout Meditation of the Divine Benefits.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ONE of the things that uses most to excite our Hearts to Love, is the Consideration of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits receiv'd. For as Man Naturally Loves himself, so also he Loves any one that does him Good. And this Law of Love is so Natural, that even Brute Beasts, and the very Tygers, Lions, and Serpents, Love and Value their Benefactors, and do them all the good they can. Now if the Beasts do this, what ought Man to do, who has the use of Reason, to know how to value what he receives? And if this Gratitude and Love be due to common Benefits, what then is due to the Divine Benefits, which are so many, and so great, that there is nothing either within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, nor any thing in Nature, or of the Gift of Grace, which is not his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And tho' these Benefits be Innumerable, yet for a help to the Memory, they may be reduc'd to Ten Ranks of Benefits, which make up that Psaltery of Ten Strings, to which King <hi>David</hi> Sung the Divine Praises, giving Thanks for the Benefits receiv'd. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these, the First is that of our Creation; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, our Preservation; the Third, our Redemption; the Fourth, our Baptism; the Fifth, our Calling; the Sixth, the Divine Inspirations; the Seventh, our Deliverances from Evils; the Eighth, that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; the Ninth, of particular Benefits; the Tenth, the Blessing of Eternal Glory, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd us. Much might be said in relation to each of these Benefits, but I will now only run over each of them briefly, for the better understanding the Value of the Benefit, and the Love and Gratitude that is due upon Account of it.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:154273:217"/>
                     <head>§. <hi>I.</hi> Of the Benefit of our CREATION.</head>
                     <p n="3">3. AMIDST all these Benefits, the first, which is also the ground of all the rest, is, that God has made us to his own Image and Likeness. So that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting thy Age, it is so many Years since thou wast Nothing, and from all Eternity thou wast Nothing, (that is, less than a Pismire, less than the least Pebble, in fine, Nothing) and thus might'st thou have been Nothing to all Eternity, and the World would have been as well without as with thee; and yet it pleas'd that Divine Goodness, without any Merit of thine, only out of infinite Mercy and Bounty, to take thee out of that Abyss, and out of that profound Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in which thou didst dwell from all Eternity, to give thee a Being, and to make thee Something, and not Any thing; that is, not a Stone, or a Bird, or a Snake, but a Man; which is one of the Noblest Creatures in the World. Under this same Benefit, he gave us this Body, with all its Limbs, and Sences; the Value of every one of which we may gather from the want of it, where it happens. He also gave us this Rational Soul, with all its Faculties, made to his own Image and Likeness; that is, Incorruptible, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, Intellectual, and Capable of God himself, and of his Bliss. By this thou may'st perceive, that if thou owest so much to thy Parents, because they were God's Instruments, for forming thy Body, thy Debt is infinitely greater to him who made use of them to Form thy Body, and without them Created thy Soul, without which the Body were but a Dumb Beast, or a Lump of Rotten Flesh.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="section">
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:154273:218"/>
                     <head>§. <hi>II.</hi> Of the Benefit of our PRESERVATION.</head>
                     <p n="4">4. THE Second Benefit is that of our Preservation. For he not only brought thee out from no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to a Being, through the Benefit of the Creation; but he also Preserves thee in this Being which he has given thee, in such a measure, that if he should turn his Eyes from thee but one Moment, thou wouldst perish, and fall back into that Nothing, out of which thou wast Created. So that, as the Sun produces out of himself the Beams of Light in the Air, and he that produces, preserves them in the Being he gave them; even so our Lord does by us, drawing us out from no Being, to a Being, and then preserving us in that same Being, so that he is always giving that which he once gave us, which is as if he were always Creating us anew.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To this purpose he Created all the things in this World; for we plainly see they Serve for the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Man, every one in its way. Some are to Feed, some to Cloath, some to Cure, some to Delight, some to Instruct, and some to Chastize him; for all these things are requisite in the House of a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is very well worth observing how Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Plentifully our Lord has furnish'd all these things. What abundance of Food did he Create to Nourish us? What variety to Cloath us? What plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Herbs to Cure us? And above all, what mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Things to Delight us? For some serve to please the Eyes, as the Flowers, and various Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; others for the Ears, as Musick, and the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Birds; some for the Smell, as all Aromatical Perfumes; some for the Taste, as the infinite sorts of Fruit, Fishes, Birds, and Beasts. All these things are more for the use of Man, than for themselves; for Man has more use and benefit by them, than they have themselves.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:154273:218"/>6. Observe therefore how kind and bountifully our Lord has dealt with thee in this Particular, and how many Benefits he bestow'd on thee in this one Benefit: For in it are comprehended all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World, which were Created for thy Use; for he had no need of them himself. And not only the Creatures upon Earth, but those also in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets; and even those that are above the Heavens, as the Angels that see the Face of God; whom though they were Created for his Glory, yet he deputed them to be our Guardians.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>III.</hi> Of the Benefit of our REDEMPTION.</head>
                     <p n="7">7. THE Third Benefit is that of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> which far exceeds all that Mortal Tongue can express. For if in it thou observe these Five Things; to wit, what our Lord gave us in this Benefit, the Means through which he gave it, the Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he gave it, the Person that gave it, and the Person that receiv'd it, each of these Particulars will produce in thee fresh Astonishment and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and thou wilt perceive, that neither the Gift could be Greater, nor the Means more Sublime, nor the Love more Perfect, nor the Person that gave it more Noble, nor the Person that receiv'd it (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the Devils) more Unworthy.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. There is much to be observ'd in each of these Particulars, and especially in the greatness of the Love wherewith our Lord perform'd this Work; which Love was great enough to have Suffer'd a Hundred-fold more than he did, if it had been requisite for our Good. There is no less in the Means he chose to do this Work, which was, to take upon him our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to make us Partakers of his Blessings. To this Place belong all the Mysteries and Passages of his Blessed Life and Death; all which are Parts of this Benefit, and each of them apart an Immense Benefit.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:154273:219"/> To this Place belong, the Humility of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Poverty of his Birth, the Bloodshed at his Circumcision, his Banishment into <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Desart, his Travels, Watchings, Sufferings, Persecutions during his Life; the Pains and Affronts of his Death, which were greater than ever were seen. For all which, and for every one in particular, we are oblig'd to give our Lord infinite Thanks, since he Sought us in such Rugged Ways, and Bought us at so Dear a Rate; to give us a clearer Testimony of his great Love, and by these Means to incite us to Love him, as he Lov'd us.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>IV.</hi> Of the Benefit of our BAPTISM.</head>
                     <p n="9">9. THE Fourth Benefit is that of <hi>Baptism,</hi> through which this Lord of Infinite Goodness and Mercy, without any precedent Merit on our Part, only out of his own Good Will and Compassion, was pleas'd to Wash us with that Water which gush'd from his most Precious Side; to banish therewith the Foulness of our Souls, and deliver us from the Tyranny of our Enemies, which are Sin, Hell, the Devil, and Death; and there to give us the Spirit of Adoption; that is, to be receiv'd as Sons of God; and to furnish us with all the Ornaments requisite for this Dignity; which are Grace, and the Infus'd Virtues and Gifts of the Holy Ghost; which may render us Beautiful in the sight of God, and give us new Strength to Triumph over the Devil: That so we may attain the End for which we were Created, which is, the Kingdom of Heaven. What Return canst thou make to our Lord for this Benefit?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. What wilt thou give him, for that amidst such a Multitude of Barbarous Nations, Infidels, <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and Gentiles, who Adore Stocks, Stones, and Venemous Creatures, our Lord was pleas'd that thou shouldst be a Christian, and that thy Lot should be in the Bosom of the Church, in the House and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:154273:219"/> Inheritance of our Lord, and in the Ark of the true <hi>Noe;</hi> that thou might'st not Perish with the rest of the World, in the Deluge of Infidelity, where so many Thousands of Souls daily Perish. Consider how many Souls God Created the same Day he Created yours; whereof some fell into <hi>Turky,</hi> others into <hi>Guinea,</hi> others into <hi>Barbary,</hi> &amp;c. Thine might also have fallen there; and our Lord would not suffer it to fall any where but into the Bosom of the Church, which is the House of the Sons of God, and of the Predestinate. What then canst thou Give to our Lord for this Benefit?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="5" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>V.</hi> Of the Benefits of our VOCATION.</head>
                     <p n="11">11. THE Fifth Benefit, is that of our <hi>Vocation.</hi> By Vocation I mean, if at any time thou did'st live lewdly, without any Fear of God; and now dost live after another manner, endeavouring all that in thee is, to shun Mortal Sin. This I call a Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it is a most powerful Reason to guess thou art call'd to Grace; for that Change seems not the Work of Flesh and Blood, but of the Hand of the Most High.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Now if after thou hadst liv'd some Time in that Miserable State, God mercifully and powerfully drew thee thence, and plac'd thee in this State, what Thanks ought'st thou to return him for this Benefit? For this is not one Benefit alone, but many others attend it. For it was one Benefit so long to expect thy Repentance, without cutting thee off in thy Wicked Course of Life; which perhaps befel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who may be for that Reason at this time suffering the Pains of Hell. Another was, to bear with so many Sins, so many Insolencies, so many Pollutions, so much Disobedience, and so much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy, as during that time he bore with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Patience. Another was, that instead of Punishment, he sent thee so many Warnings, so many
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:154273:220"/> Instructers, and so many Holy Inspirations; to Awake thee out of thy Lethargy, and Draw thee out of that Danger. Another was, to Call thee so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as that thou becomest able to break the Chains that bound thee: To wit, the Pleasure of Vice, the Power of Satan, and the Strength of an Ill Habit; which is the Threefold Cord wherewith the Devil binds his Servants, and which is most difficult to break. Another was, to Receive thee after all, like to the Prodigal Son, into his House, and to forgive thee so many Sins; if perchance thou art yet Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; to make the Way to Heaven easie to thee, and to give thee another Heart; whereby that which before was sweet to thee, might become bitter, and that which was bitter, sweet; that so thou might'st persevere in doing Good.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But above all it is most to be observ'd, That our Lord did all this of his pure Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that is, before any Merit could be on thy Part; because in that State nothing can be done that is Meritorious, or of Value, in his sight. How many Thousands of Souls then dost thou think are now perhaps in Hell, because our Lord did not use so great Mercy towards them: That is, either because he expected them not so long, or because he bore not with them so patiently, or because he call'd them not so powerfully, or else because he did not confirm them with such Abundant Grace? And what didst thou more than they? What didst thou deserve more than they, to be so much more happy than they? If thou art one of the two that were grinding in the same Mill, or sleeping in the same Bed; that is, in the same Sensual Pleasure, or in the same Sin, Why shouldst thou rather be he that was taken to Glory, than he that was left to Punishment, since you were both in the same Guilt? Why shouldst thou be chosen to become a Precious Vessel of God's Table, and the other left to be a foul Vessel, us'd by the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Look back upon thy past Years, and call to mind the Children and young Men who were thy
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:154273:220"/> Neighbours, or Friends, or Companions in thy Vices, <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>elf then to God, and say, <q>Lord, what didst thou see in me? What need hadst thou of me? What Service had I done thee? Whence comes such a Blessing to me, that thou shouldst send this Ray of Light to me, leaving them in their Darkness? What Thanks shall I give thee for this Benefit? With what Words shall I praise thee for this Mercy? Let my Tongue and my Heart praise thee, O Lord, and may all my Bones say, Lord, who is like unto thee? Who could have made this Change, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee? Who could have deliver'd me from the Jaws of that Infernal Dragon, but thou? Who could have made the Sweet, Bitter, and the Bitter, Sweet to me, but thou? <hi>Praise the Lord,</hi> (says the Prophet) <hi>because he is good, and because his Mercy continues for ever.</hi> What Tongue can express his Praises? <hi>Let them praise him,</hi> (says he) <hi>who have been redeemed by the Lord, those whom he delivered from the Hands of their Enemies:</hi> For they who have Experience of that great Benefit, will have singular Tongues to praise him.</q>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="6" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>VI.</hi> Of the Benefit of DIVINE INSPIRATIONS.</head>
                     <p n="15">15. THE Sixth Benefit is that of the <hi>Inspirations,</hi> and <hi>Good Purposes,</hi> which our Lords gives us, whereby he stirs up and excites us to all that is Good. For as the Heart is always sending out Spirits and Warmth to all the Limbs of the Body; so the Holy Ghost (who according to St. <hi>Thomas</hi>) is as it were the Heart of the Church, is continually inspiring Good Thoughts and Holy Purposes into the Heart
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:154273:221"/> where he dwells. Now according to this, all the Good Works thou hast done, all the Good Purposes and Desires thou hast had, all the Tears thou hast shed, all the Consolations thou hast receiv'd of the Holy Ghost, all the Virtuous Steps thou hast ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, all the Pious Sentiments thou hast enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, all the Holy Thoughts that thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and all wherein thou hast prosper'd, are all Benefits of God. For as every Drop of Water that falls on the Earth comes from the Sea, which is the Source of all Waters; so all the Good that happens to Man, proceeds from the Abyss of all Good, which is GOD.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Therefore, as when a Man in a Lethargy is most heavy and drowsie, another stands by his Side, who prompts him every Moment to keep awake; so must we imagine the Holy Ghost is near us doing the same thing; and this in such different Ways and Manners, and so continually, as if he had nothing else to attend to, but only that Business. Therefore every time a Man feels an Inward Call to Awake, and Think upon God, or every time he goes about some Good Work, he ought presently to Acknowledge the Benefit of the Divine Presence, profoundly to humble himself to it in his Soul, to give Thanks for this Grace, and immediately to go about what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="7" type="section">
                     <head>§. <hi>VII.</hi> Of the Benefit of our DELIVERANCE from EVILS.</head>
                     <p n="17">17. THE Seventh Benefit is the <hi>Deliverance</hi> from <hi>Evils,</hi> which comprehends all the Evils in the World, from which our Lord in his Mercy has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd us. Among which there are Natural Evils, Evils of Fortune, and Evils of Sin; which are all the Sorts of Evils there are in the World.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Now thou may'st be assur'd, there is no Evil which one Man has, that another may not have; being a Man as well as the other, a Son of <hi>Adam</hi> as
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:154273:221"/> well as he, Conceiv'd in Original Sin like him; and in short, his Companion in the same Nature, and the same Guilt, and consequently subject to the same Misery.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Now according to this, thou wilt find, that all the Evils there are in the World, are thy Benefits; for thou might'st have fallen into them all, if God in his Mercy had not deliver'd thee. Thou seest one Man Blind, another Lame, another Mad, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other troubled with the Gout, another with the Stone, another in a Goal, another a Slave, another Condemned to the Galleys, another to Death, and a Thousand other Evils, which appear every Hour and every Moment in this World. Every time thou happ'nest to see any of these, thou oughtest to bend thy Heart to God, and lift up thy Hands to Heaven, saying, Lord, this I owe unto thee: Be thy Holy Name Blessed for evermore; for I might have been as this Man is, or as that Man; and if I were so, perhaps I might be Impatient, and desire to End my Life; and would give all the Wealth in the World, that I might not be in that Condition, I would cast my self at his Feet that should deliver me from it, and offer my self for his Slave as long as I liv'd. Therefore I humbly cast my self at thy Feet, O my Lord, and give thee infinite Thanks, because thou in thy Infinite Mercy hast so directed my Life, that I am free from all those Evils.</p>

                  <div n="8" type="section">

                     <p n="20">20. THE Eighth Benefit is that of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and particularly those of Confession, and Communion, which we enjoy often. How great then is thy Debt to our Lord, for having left thee a Fountain open in his Side, that there thou might'st Bathe thy self, and Wash thy Soul from the Filth of Sin, as often as thou would'st? What is the Sacrament of Confession, but a most pure Spring, to wash away our Stains, a most perfect Medicine to heal our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:154273:222"/> and a most powerful Means to Reconcile us with God, at the Expence of the Blood of <hi>Christ?</hi> If thou wert Condemn'd to an Ignominious Death, or to be publickly Whipp'd through the Streets, and a Friend of thine, out of meer Generosity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, should undergo that Shame, and receive those Stripes for thee; and if thou sawest him thus Scourg'd about the Streets, with a Rope about his Neck, how would'st thou Look upon him? How heartily would'st thou Thank him for so Signal a Favour? The same thou ought'st to conceive of the Sacrament of Confession. For thou wast Condemn'd to Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Eternal Death, for thy Sins; and the Son of God, out of meer Mercy and Compassion, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and receiv'd the Sentence and Stripes due to thee: And in virtue of this Satisfaction, Almighty God commands the Priest to Absolve thee from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Punishment, because he has taken Satisfaction for thy Debt of his Son. Then with what a Heart, with what Eyes, with what Love, ought'st thou to behold him that has done all this for thee? And what ought'st thou to do for Him?</p>
                     <p n="21">21. What then shall I say of the Sacrament of the Eucharist? This is the Sacrament of Sacraments, the Mystery of Mysteries, the Benefit of Benefits, and the Memorial of all the Wonders of God. This is the Sacrament of Grace, the Sacrament of Love the Sacrament of Union, the Sacrament of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Remission of Sins, and of all Happiness. Here Man is Visited by God, here he is Honour'd by the Divine Presence, here he is made the Living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> here Grace is given most abundantly, here the Divine Sweetness is tasted in its proper Source, here the Fire of the Love of God is kindled, here the Soul Embraces her true and lawful Spouse, which causes in her wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. This is the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> for to Travel to Heaven; and this is the Bread of Labourers, which strengthens those that Labour in the Vineyard of our Lord. Here Good Purposes are renew'd, here Good Desires bud anew, here Devotion increases, here the Fountains of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:154273:222"/> Tears are open'd, here the Youth of the Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd; and here, to conclude, it is maintain'd, and feeds on <hi>Christ,</hi> who is her proper Food, and the greatest Good she can receive in this World. For to Eat Christ, is nothing else but to become Partakers of his Spirit, of his Blood, of his Grace, of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and of his Sufferings. For as he who eats, makes that his own which he eats; so he who eats <hi>Christ,</hi> applies to himself the Spirit, and the Grace of <hi>Christ:</hi> To the End, that being now Transform'd into him, he may in some measure be look'd upon by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father with the same Eyes that he is; not as a Stranger and Alien, but as his Son. What Return shall we then make to our Lord, for so Sovereign a Benefit?</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>IX.</hi> Of PARTICƲLAR BENEFITS.</head>
                     <p n="22">22. ALL the Benefits we have hitherto Treated of, are for the most part common to all the Faithful. Now there remain the Private and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Benefits, that every one may have receiv'd; of which, as no Man can give a full Account, so he that has receiv'd, is most sensible of them. Run over then all those Three Sorts of Goods which are found in Man; to wit, the Natural Goods, Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Goods of Grace; and observe wherein God has plac'd thee above many other Men, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thou art so much indebted to Him. As to the Goods of Nature, consider the Natural Parts he has given thee; the Wit, Disposition, Discretion, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Country, the Lineage, the Strength, the Health, and the like. In the Goods of Fortune, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Estate he has given thee, the Honour, the Station, the Employment, and such other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which are not Born with us, but came to us afterwards, through the Special Providence of God, tho' the World calls them Goods of Fortune. In respect of the Goods of Grace, observe whether
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:154273:223"/> thou hast particularly receiv'd any of our Lord; as Tears, Devotion, Chastity, Charity, Contempt of Riches, of Preferments, and Honours, and a Satisfaction with what God hath given thee. Observe whether he has long preserv'd thee from Mortal Sin, which is a great and signal Token of Divine Grace. Observe what Dangers and Temptations thou hast overcome by his Grace, and other things of this nature.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Consider also amongst the Goods of Grace, what Conveniencies our Lord has furnish'd thee with to Live Well; what Instructions, what Confessors, what Preachers, what Companions; what Doctrine, what Employment, and what Condition he has put thee into: Whether thou be a Priest, or well Marry'd, or free from the Burden of Matrimony, and livest thus contentedly, which is a greater Blessing than the other.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Above all, observe whether thou art a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Man, especially in a Province, or Monastery, where Regular Observance flourishes; for if there be any thing upon Earth that represents Heaven, it is a Congregation that strictly observes a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. There are other Benefits, yet more conceal'd than these, which even he that possesses them is not sensible of. For many times our Lord infuses some Gifts and Virtues so privately into the Soul, that he who receives them knows it not; as Holy <hi>Job</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, saying, <hi>If he shall come to me, I shall not see him; and if he depart, my Soul will not know it.</hi> So also we read of <hi>Moses,</hi> that when he came down from the Mount with his Face full of Splendor, he saw not the Light he brought, till he was told of it by others. And to do this, is a double Mercy in our Lord, because it secures us from the Danger of Pride, that so Grace may rest more securely in us, which is, as if one gave a Treasure, and a Key to secure it.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. And as there are conceal'd Gifts, so also there are conceal'd Deliverances from Evils, which the Man that is preserv'd knows not of. What knowest
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:154273:223"/> thou, whether when thou wast about going through some Street, (where some occasion of Sin might offer it self, as it did to <hi>David</hi>) God diverted thee from taking that Way; or put it in thy Heart to take another, that thou might'st shun that Danger? How many times may our Lord have done that by us, which he did for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he said to him, Peter, <hi>Satan was very busie, that he might sift and fan you like Corn; but I prayed for thee, that thy Faith might not fail.</hi> How many times may our Lord have prevented our Dangers by his Fatherly Providence, and put a Stop to the Proceedings of the Devil; and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Strength of our Adversary, that he might not prevail against us? We are not to return less Thanks for these secret and hidden Benefits, than for those that are visible, but rather more. For, (as a Divine fitly says) as we ought to beg Pardon for our secret Sins, we are to be Thankful to him for hidden Benefits.</p>

                     <p n="27">27. THE Tenth Benefit is that of our <hi>Glorification,</hi> which is promis'd us hereafter as a Crown, and is now possess'd in Hope. Here a Man may dilate as much as he pleases, upon the Consideration of this Divine Reward; here he may lift up his Eyes, and consider the Greatness of this Blessing, which is laid up in store for us. Ascend then in Spirit, Dear Christian, to this Celestial Region, and attentively observe what a Sight it will be, to behold the Beauty of that Glorious City, those Walls, and Gates of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones? Those Streets of Pure Gold? And those Fountains of Waters of Life? What a Sight will it be, to behold those Nine Choirs of Angels di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into their Hierarchies; so Beautiful, so Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, so Richly Adorn'd, and so Bright?</p>
                     <p n="28">28. What a Sight will it be to behold those Ranks of Virgins, of Confessors, of Martyrs, of Apostles, of Patriarchs, and of Prophets? What to behold
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:154273:224"/> the most Blessed Virgin, our Lady and Advocate, exalted above all the Choirs of Angels? What to behold the most Sacred Humanity of Christ, our Lord and Brother, Seated on the Right Hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mediating for us, and taking Care of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? Above all, what will it be to behold him, to see whom, is to see All, to enjoy All, to possess All, and to know All at once? What will it be to behold that Infinite Splendor? That Immense Beauty? That Abyss of Riches? That Ocean of Delight? And that Source of all Felicity? What will it be, to hear that Musick? To sit down at that Table? To walk those Streets? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with those Noble, those Holy, those Beautiful, and those Wise Citizens? How great then is thy Debt to our Lord, who Created thee for so much Bliss? Who Redeem'd thee, who has Expected thee till now? And who always Assists thee to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Crown?</p>

                     <p n="29">29. FOR all these Benefits, thou art oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Infinite Thanks to our Lord, and for the Doing of it with the more Attention, it is Good Advice, that in thy Thanksgiving thou direct thy Words to our LORD, and offer thy Discourse to him. For (as has been said above) the Heart is more Attentive, and the Spirit more Elevated, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, when it reflects on these things, discoursing concerning them with God, than when he Meditates on them to it self: Because the Discoursing with that Supream Majesty, of it self elevates, and draws up the Spirit of Man; and consequently, he is not so negligent, or slothful, or so easie to be drawn away by every Thought; because the Reverence and Fear of him, to whom he directs his Discourse, keeps his Heart more setled and quiet.</p>

                  <head type="sub">An Introduction to Seven Devout Prayers for Begging of the Love of God.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NEXT to the Consideration of the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, there follow other Considerations, as well of the Divine Perfections, as of the Love our Lord bears towards Man; because one of the things that most excite to Love, is being Belov'd. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Love which our Lord bears us, is singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifested in our Lord's Prayer, where it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that God is our Father, and we his Adopted Children; therefore after the Three first Prayers, which relate to the Divine Perfections; Three others are set down upon the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> or Lord's Prayer; and another at the End, wherein Man with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Desire begs of God his Love, that this Number of Seven may answer to the Days of the Week; so that a Man may say one Prayer every Day, not to Nauseate himself with saying the same always. At the end of every one of these Prayers, he may add the foregoing Canticle or Hymn, calling upon all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to assist him in Praising their Common Lord. This will much conduce to inflame our Love towards him: Because to Love, being to Wish well; or at least this being one of the chief Effects of Love, we can Wish nothing more to our Lord, but that he may be Prais'd and Glorify'd by all his Creatures. For he being full of all Happiness, wants (if we may so Term it) only this; tho' this neither be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, because he stands not in need of it, but in us from whom it is due.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:154273:225"/>2. For the performing hereof more Devoutly, there are Psalms proper in <hi>David</hi>'s Psalter. For as there are Seven notable Penitential Psalms, so also there are Six very Remarkable ones, of the Divine Praises; which are,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Benedic anima mea Domino, &amp; omnia qua intra,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 102. <hi>Benedic anima mea Domino, Domine Deus meus,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 103. <hi>Exaltabo te Deus meus Rex &amp; benedicam,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 144. <hi>Lauda anima mea Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 145. <hi>Laudate Dominum quoniam bonus est Psalmus,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 146. <hi>Laudate Dominum de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, laudate eum,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 148.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The two first of these Psalms are in the Matins for <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the rest at the end of the Psalter, as may be seen by their Numbers. The Devout Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of God may stir up his Heart by these Divine Words, every time he thinks fit, or repeat one of these Psalms after each of these Seven Prayers; or if he cannot do that, he may (as has been said above) conclude each Prayer with the Hymn set down above, or else with the <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> according as he shall find most suitable to his Inclination.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The first Prayer of the Divine Perfections.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I <hi>Will Love thee, O Lord, my Strength:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 17.1.</note> (says the Prophet) <hi>Our Lord is my Firmament, and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and my Deliverer. My God is my Helper, and I will Hope in him.</hi> Had our Will continu'd in that Purity, in which thou, O Lord, didst Create, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich it with the Gifts of thy Grace; it would not stand in need of so many Motives and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to incline it to thy Love. For Dainties set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Palat invite it to Eat; but since the Taste was paul'd by Sin, many helps are requisite to make the Bread of Angels pleasing to those who have set their Minds upon the Food of Beasts. And since the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:154273:226"/> Nature of our Will is to Love all things that are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Excellent, I would now willingly lift up my Eyes, to behold the Light of thy Perfections, and of thy Wonderful Existence; that I might thus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame my Cold Heart in thy Love. Run over then, O my Soul, run over, like a careful Bee, all the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Perfections, that are in this Enclos'd Garden; rest upon each of them, and gather thence the Dew of Eternal Sweetness, to Nourish and Fill thy self with this Celestial Liquor.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. May I Love thee, my Lord, with all my Heart, with all my Soul, and with all my Strength, as thou dost Command me, for thou art infinitely Perfect, and therefore deservest to be infinitely Lov'd. In thee alone is found the Beauty and Perfection of all Creatures, and all that is seen Dispers'd in this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious World, which thou Createdst, is infinitely in a higher Perfection in thee. For if thou gavest to all Creatures all the Perfections they have, and none can give what he has not; of necessity there must be in thee all that which thou gavest, to all thou didst Create without thee. If there were but one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the World, and under him a Multitude of Governours and Officers; it is a plain Case, that all the Power and Jurisdiction of them all would reside in a much higher Degree, in that Only and Supream Prince, from whom all the rest deriv'd their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And since thou, O Lord, art the Supream Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and Monarch of this World, and the Creator of all the Perfection that is in it; it follows of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, all this must be found in thee, because thou didst Create it all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that the Master, who has Charge of a Scholar, and is to Educate him in Wisdom, must of necessity himself be a Wise Man, to make his Scholar so. Then since thou, O Lord, dost Direct all things to their Ultimate Perfection; it follows, that must be in a higher Degree in thee, which thou dost impart to all thy Creatures. This is the reason why the Holy Scripture does assign thee so many Names, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thus to express the Multitude of thy Infinite
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:154273:226"/> Perfections. Sometimes it styles thee the Sun, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Light, sometimes a Sea, sometimes an Eagle, sometimes a Lion, sometimes a Lamb, sometimes Celestial Bread, sometimes Water of Life, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Morning Star, sometimes the Flower of the Field, sometimes the Lilly of the Valley, and the like; because thou, O Lord, being an Abyss of all Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and the Creatures being so Poor, if compar'd with thee; many and sundry Comparisons are us'd to express that which could not be signify'd by one. For this reason some Philosophers said, thou couldst not be more fitly compar'd to any thing, than to the World which thou didst Create; yet so that we should lay aside all that is in it Imperfect and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and attribute to thee all that was Perfect. For as when we say, that a Statue is the Image of a Man, we do not mean that the Stone whereof it is made, is his Image, but only the Figure and Shape; so also, when we say, this World is thy Likeness, we may lay aside all that is Material and Imperfect, and apply to thee all that is Perfect. In this Sense we properly say, the World is most like to thee; for as all things are in this Visible World, so also they are in thee, in a more Excellent Manner. Thus, thou art a Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld of Perfection and Beauty; a World of Wisdom and Omnipotence; a World of Goodness, of Sweetness, of Justice, of Mercy, and of all Riches. And as all things that are in the World are present to it, in such manner, that none can be so hid, as not to be present to it; so neither is there any Body that is not present in thy sight, because nothing can be hid from thy Greatness, and infinite Wisdom. For which reason the Prophet said, <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit; and whither shall I fly from thy Face? If I shall ascend into Heaven, thou art there; and if I shall descend into Hell, thou art present. If I shall take my Wings early, and dwell in the extreme Parts of the Sea; thither also shall thy Hand conduct me; and thy Right Hand shall hold me.</hi> For if the World comprehends, and contains all things, much more does thy Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency grasp them; and therefore no Man can find a
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:154273:227"/> way to fly from thy Divine Power; and he that has not Appeas'd thee, may be assur'd he shall find thee in thy Wrath, according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>Neither does it avail to fly to the East, or to the West, nor to the desart Mountains, because God is judge of all things, and sees all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore, as we call Man a little World in comparison of this great one, because he is an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the greater; so we call thee, O Lord, the greatest World, because this little one proceeded from thee, as the Effect from the Cause, and as the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship from the Workman. Therefore all that is in it is in thee; only with this difference, that in the World it is imperfectly, as in a Creature; but in thee most perfectly, as in the Almighty Creator. In it things are Corporeal, and Temporally, as Corruptible things, but in thee they are Spiritual, Eternal, and Divinely, because in God all things are Good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From this great World proceeded this small one, Beautiful from one Beautiful, Rich from one Rich, and Perfect from one Perfect, yet Visible from one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and Temporal from one Eternal. For tho' it was made out of nothing, as to the Matter, yet it was not made out of nothing, as to the Form, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd according to the Figure and Model of it that was in thee. For as in the Seed, in a wonderful and secret manner the whole Tree is contain'd; so in thee, who art the Maker of the World, is the whole World which proceeded from thee; excepting that the Tree is in its Seed, as in its Material Cause, and therefore is there confus'd, and imperfectly, as a Letter is in the Ink, and a House in the Materials whereof it is made; but in thee the World is as in its Efficient and Formal Cause, and therefore it is in thee more distinct and perfectly than in it self.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And if it be lawful to compare great things to small, as in a Printing-house, besides the Master-Printer who governs the Press, there are many Sorts and Varieties of Letters, some great, and some small; some of one kind, and some of another; so, my God, I look upon thy Divine Understanding, as it were
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:154273:227"/> upon a great and Royal Work-house, where the whole impression of this World receiv'd its stamp, and in which there is not only the Efficient Virtue of all things, but Infinite Sort of Moulds, and most Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Figures, from which proceeded all the several Forms and Species of things Created which we see, and do not see; tho' in thee these Forms are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but only one, which is thy most Simple Essence, which is communicated to several Creatures in several manners. So that there is no Creature without thee, which has not its Form and Model in thee, according to which it was fram'd. These are the Idea's Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers plac'd in thy Divine Understanding, which are as it were the Moulds of Letters that are in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-house, which produced this Beautiful World, and could with the same ease have produced a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more Worlds, because there were in thee Models and Perfections enough for them all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Then if thou, my God, didst give their Being and Perfection to all things, it follows that they are all in thee in a Sublime manner. In thee are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of all the Angels, the Greatness of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Brightness of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Virtue of the Planets, the Beauty of the Fields, the Gracefulness of the Flowers, the Verdure of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, the Clearness of the Springs, the Sweetness of Tastes, the Odour of Perfumes, the Learning of the Wise, the Courage of the Valiant, the Strength of the Strong, and the Holiness of the Saints. All these things therefore shall he enjoy who enjoys thee, and all these things will he see in thee more perfectly than if he saw them in themselves; for this reason this is call'd Knowledge of the Afternoon, and that which is in thee of the Morning. Now if the Perfection of all things be so Amiable, how much more art thou so, my God, in whom all Perfections are infinitely more Transcendent? May I then love thee, my God, if not as much as thou deservest, at least as much as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me in this Life. May I love thee with all my Heart, with all my Soul, and with the utmost of all my Strength. O most Sweet, most Benign, most Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:154273:228"/> most Dear, most Pleasing, most Amiable, most Beautiful, most Merciful, most Clement, most High, Admirable, Ineffable, Inestimable, Incomparable, Powerful, Magnificent, Great, Incomprehensible, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Immense, all Mighty, all Pitiful, all Loving; more Sweet than Honey, more White than the Snow, more Ravishing than all Delights, more Pleasing than all delicious Liquors, more valuable than Gold, and Precious Stones; and what have I said, when I say all this? My God, my Life, my only Hope, my very great Mercy, and my blessed Sweetness? O thou all Amiable, all Sweet, and all Delightful. Give me the Grace, my Lord, that I may Rejoice in thee alone, Rest in thee alone, always Love thee, Serve thee, Think on thee being awake by Day, and Dream on thee Sleeping at Night; that so I may be always wholly thine, and thou always mine, World without End. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">The Second Prayer of the Divine Perfections.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. MAY I Love thee, O Lord my God, and my Creator, for the sake of thy most Noble and most Perfect Being, which in thee is so Essential, and so Absolutely thine, that no Understanding conceiving what God is, can imagine thou shouldst cease to be. For if thou wert not, nothing would exist, since all that has a Being depends on thee. But thy Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on no Body, but on thy Self, because it is not a Being by Participation, but thy own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not Limited, or Bounded, but Universal and Infinite, as comprehending in it self all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. May I also Love thee, my Lord, because thou art the Rule and Pattern of all things, and (as a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher said) the Measure of all Substances; for the nearer every one approaches to thee, and the more it
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:154273:228"/> partakes of thee, so much the more Noble, and the more Perfect it becomes in its Essence. Among these those things are in the meanest place, which have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Being, as the Elements; somewhat nearer are those which have only Life, as the Plants; next to these those that have Sense, as the Beasts; then those that have Wisdom and Understanding, as Men; but above all these, they that are in a State of Grace and Charity, because they are nearer to thee, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more largely of thy Goodness; for, (as thy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist said) <hi>God is Charity, and he that is in Charity, is in God, and God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. May I also Love thee, my Lord, because thou art the most Universal Cause of all things, which the Philosophers found out by strength of Reason; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that it was impossible to proceed <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> with Causes Essentially Ordain'd, but that all of them must at last have a Resting-place, and End in that first Cause, from whence they all Proceeded, and by which they were all Mov'd; and which is, as it were, the Prime Movement in a Watch, that moves all the rest; or the Supreme Head in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by which the others are Influenc'd; and which thou art in this great Commonwealth of the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. May I also Love thee, my Lord, because thou art Life, a most happy Life, and Author of all that has Life. For if it be better to Live, than to want Life, and thou art the best of all things, it follows, that thou hast Life; and if Rational Life be better than the Irrational, it follows thy Life is Rational and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, above the reach of our Understanding. And if a Happy Life be better than the Unhappy, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thy Life is Happy; and because thou art grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better than all things, it follows thy Life must be Happy above all Lives. May I Love thee then, O Lord my God, the Fountain of Felicity and Life, of whom all things that Live receiv'd their Life, in whom we Live, Move, and have our Being; and by whom, and for whom, all things Live, that Live Happily.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:154273:229"/>5. May I also Love thee, my Lord, because thou art the most powerful Supporter and Maintainer of all Creatures; which as they could not come from Non-Existence to Exist, without thee; so neither could they continue in that Being, without thee. Thou art he that sittest upon the Thrones of Heaven, and thence thy Sight reacheth down to the Abyss. Thou holdest (as the Prophet says) the Globe of the Earth, hanging by Three Fingers; to wit, by thy Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, thy Wisdom, and thy Goodness; whereby thou didst distribute upon it the Hills and Mountains in their due proportion. Thou didst shut in the Sea with Doors, and didst give Laws to it; and saidst, Thus far thou shalt come, and shalt not go farther, and here shalt thou break the Fury of thy Waves. Of thee that Great Christian Philosopher <hi>Boetius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly sings, in his Verses, saying, <hi>O Supream God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who with Perpetual Laws Governest the World, who didst command Time from its beginning to go on in order; and being thy self always the same, dost change and move all things: Thou art their Beginning and Support, thou their Guide, Way, and Ʋltimate End; thou art the Harbour and Resting-Place of Good Men; and to see thy Face, is the utmost of all our Desires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. May I also Love thee, my God, because thou art the Fountain of Wisdom, from which flow all the Treasures of Wisdom and Learning. For, as this visible Sun is the Original and Cause of all the Light of the World, and through him we see all we see; so thou art an Invisible Light, and the Sun of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, from whence the Light they have is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, through whose Light they understand what they understand. Thou art the Reason and Order of all things, and he who according to the Rule of thy most Righteous Will didst place them in the Order and Rank that pleas'd thee. Thou madest some Creatures Corporeal, and some Spiritual, and others betwixt them, partaking of both kinds. Some thou madest Corruptible, and some Incorruptible, some Simple, and some Compound, some to Rule, and some to be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:154273:229"/> Rul'd, some to Cause, and others to be Caus'd, some most Lofty and Noble, others Low and Vile, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a Mean betwixt them both, as was proper for the Perfection of this Universe. Thou also didst appoint all things their Places, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore didst place some on High, others Low, and others in the Middle, that so there might be no Place in the World void of the Works of thy Hands, and every thing might have the Place that best suited with its Nature. Thus thou didst ordain infinite things differing among themselves, and yet all tending to the same end; and out of them all thou mad'st so Sweet a Harmony, so Beautiful a World, and so Perfect a Commonwealth, that it is above all Comparison.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now if Wisdom be so great a good, and so worthy to be valued, and if thine be so great, as appears by the Universality of thy Works, why shall not I value thee? Why shall not I love thee with all my Strength, and with all my Heart? Why shall not all thy Works be Witnesses of thy Glory? Mirrors of thy Beauty? Testimonies of thy Wisdom? And Incitements of thy Love? For all of them unanimously Encourage us to love thee. May I also love thee, my God, because thou art Essential and Infinite Goodness; for Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not in thee as a Quality, but as thy Essence, in such manner that thy very Nature is Goodness it self. This plainly appears in thy Works, because every thing is so much the more Good, by how much it is more Communicative, as the Sun is among Corporeal Creatures, which so liberally Communicates its Light and its Heat to all the World. And who is there, my God, on Earth, or in Heaven, so Beautiful, and so Communicative, as thou art? What Creature is there, tho' never so little, that does not in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure partake of thee? That is not full of thy Riches? For none has any other Being, but what thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it. So that thou art the Treasure of the whole World, thou the Supream, and most Universal Good. Hence it is, that as all things naturally desire their Perfection, and their own Advantage, so all desire to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:154273:230"/> approach to thee, and partake of thee, who art their Perfection, and their Chief Good; wherefore even the first Matter (which is the meanest thing thou hast Created, and most void of Being) as having so poor a Being, desires a Being through which it may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take something of thee, and have some sort of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with thee.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now if this vile Creature that has neither Eyes to see thee, nor a Will to love thee, nor so much as an entire Being to make it something, being so void and destitute of all things, yet is not void of thy Love and Natural Desire; what ought he to do, my God, who has Eyes of Reason wherewith to know thee, a Heart fitted to love thee, and on whom alone thou hast bestow'd all the Benefits thou didst ever confer on all the Creatures of the World, for which reason he is call'd a lesser World? How can he who has receiv'd so much, who is so much indebted, who sees so much, and who with thy Assistance can love thee so much, how can he, I say, suffer himself to be outdone by the first Matter in seeking thy Love? May I then love thee, my Lord, for this infinite Goodness which is in thee, which is the most Powerful Cause of Love, and from which all our Happiness proceeds. For as it is the Natural Property of the Sun to give Light, of Fire to give Heat, and of Snow to Cool; even so, and much more, is it Natural to thee to do Good, and Communicate thy self to all. Who then can be so much an Enemy to himself, as not to love such Goodness from which he receives so much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? Assuredly, O Lord, (says St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) we all run to thee, by reason of the information we have of thy great Meekness, for thou dost not despise the Poor Man, thou dost not fly from the Sinner, thou didst not turn away the Thief that confess'd thee, nor the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> that call'd upon thee, nor her that was taken in Adultery, nor the Evangelist that sate in the Toll-house, nor the Publican that pray'd in the Temple, nor the Disciple that deny'd thee, nor the Persecutor of thy Disciples, nor even those that Crucify'd thee. For this Reason, O Lord, we run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:154273:230"/> thee in the Odour of these most Precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for there is nothing in the World more Sweet, more Amiable, or more easie to be Appeased, than thou. Since then, my God, thou art so great an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss, and not only an Abyss, but a World of so many Perfections and Virtues, how can I chuse but love thee with all my Heart, and with all my Strength? And if every one of thy Perfections, as being infinite, deserves to be infinitely belov'd, how shall I love him who possesses infinite Perfections? With what Tongue shall I praise thee? With what Words shall I declare thy Greatness? And with what Bowels shall I love thy Goodness. The Debt, O Lord, is well known, and so is the Poverty of the Debtor. Do thou, O Lord, supply this defect; and since thou deservest so much Love, and dost so earnestly command me to love thee, give me a new Heart, wherewith I may love thee as thou ordainest; for to thee alone is due Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love; Perpetual Praise, Eternal Glory, Supream Power, an Eternal Kingdom, and Empire without End, for Ever and Ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">The Third Prayer of the Divine Perfections.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IF Beauty be one of the Chiefest among all the things that provoke us to love, why shall not I love thee, my Lord, since thou art the Source of all Beauty? Thou art the Beauty of the Universe, for thou hast Created all things, and every one of them Beautiful in its Proportion; whose Beauty the Sun and Moon admire; whose Face the Angels covet to Behold; in whose Sight consists the Glory and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of all the Heavenly Spirits. From thee the Birds, the Flowers, the Springs, the Fields, the Sea, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Trees, the Woods, the Earth, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Valleys, and all Things, receiv'd their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thou didst Beautifie the Heaven with Stars, the Air with Birds, the Sea with Fish, the Fields with
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:154273:231"/> Flowers, and the Earth with infinite variety of Beasts and Plants. In all Parts of the World thou art Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, because in all of them there are Marks and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of thy Beauty. In Heaven thou art Beautiful in Glory, in Hell by thy Justice; in the Just by Grace, and in the Wicked by Patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. May I also Love thee, my Lord, because thou art the Perfection of all things. Thou art the Glory of Angels, the Reward of the Saints, the Hope of the Patriarchs, the Light of the Prophets, the Joy of the Apostles, the Crown of Martyrs, the Blessing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, the Purity of Virgins, and the Salvation of all the Elect. Thee the Blessed Spirits Praise; before thee the Pillars of Heaven Shake, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World Reverence and Worship thee. Thou Fillest all things without Dilating thy self; thou Passest through them without Moving, and art In them without Confinement. Thou didst Create them without standing in Need of them, thou Governest them without Trouble, and Changest them without being Chang'd. Only thou Judgest without doing Wrong, only thou Punishest without Anger, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest without Diminishing thy Treasures. For if the Sea, which is not Infinite, be not Lessened by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so much Water to the Earth, how can thy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which are Infinite, be Lessened by thy giving? Thou alone art most sufficient for thy self, and for all things. And therefore he that has only thee, has all things; and he that has not thee, tho' he have all other things, is Poor, Miserable, and a Beggar.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All these, and infinite other Praises and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which neither Mortal Tongue can Express, nor Human Understanding Conceive, are in thee, my God; therefore the greatest Praise our low State can give thee, is to say, Thou art altogether Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, and (as a Philosopher said) thou art to be Venerated with Silence, giving this Supream Glory to thy Substance, that only it is Infinite in Essence, in Omnipotence, in Wisdom, in Goodness, in Beauty, and in all other respects; and as it is Infinite in all things, so it cannot be Comprehended by our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:154273:231"/> much less Express'd by our Mortal Tongue. Therefore, as if there could be found a bottomless Sea, after descending a Thousand Millions of Leagues into it, there would still remain an Infinite Number more; so after the Created Understanding has pierc'd Deep into the Profundity of thy Excellencies, there still remains an Infinite Stock to discover. For thou art that great God, of whom it is written, He is Higher than the Heaven, more Profound than the Abyss, Longer than the Earth, and Wider than the Sea.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>This is the God great in Strength,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 36.</note>
                     <hi>and there is none among the Wise, and Law-makers, to compare with him. Who can search his Ways? Or who can say to him, Thou hast wrought Iniquity? Remember that thou knowest not his Work, whereof Men have Sung. All Men see him, every one beholdeth afar off. Behold, God is Great, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting our Knowledge; the Number of his Years is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable.</hi> By this it plainly appears, that thou, O Lord, art Inestimable, and Incomprehensible in all respects. Thou art Higher than all that can be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, or Conceiv'd; Higher than all that can be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, or Thought of; nay, more, thou art Higher than all that can be Lov'd or Desir'd, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensness of thy Greatness exceeds all this. So that (as St. <hi>Dionisius</hi> says) thou art Incomprehensible to all Creatures, because neither the Sence can reach thee, nor the Imagination, nor Conceit, nor Reason, nor Wisdom, nor any other Created Virtue. And since thy Immensness, O Lord, surpasses all our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, the best of our Confession, and the best of our Praise will be to own, thou art Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. This even the Philosophers Confessed; this one of them Testifies in these Terms, <hi>If thou observe</hi> (says he) <hi>the Words of</hi> Plato, <hi>thou wilt find that God is so High, and so Noble a Substance, that no Words or Ʋnderstanding can comprehend him. And if thou say any thing of him, thou may'st speak of his Creatures, but canst never reach him. Thou may'st say he is the Cause of all things, but no Ʋnderstanding can Conceive who he is, and in what manner he is. For our Ʋnderstandings presently incline us to our own things; and all we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:154273:232"/> we understand after our own manner, thinking it is as we are; and that which is not as we are, we do not know, nor can we guess how it is. Let this then be the Prime Truth and Confession of the First Principle, to know that he is Incomprehensible; and therefore when thou hast Ador'd him, calling him Incomprehensible and Ineffable, the next Honour thou shalt offer him shall be to Confess, that he is the Common Desire of all things; and the Third, that he is the Beginning and Cause of them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If a Philosopher, void of the Light of Faith, could say thus much; what ought he to say of thee, O Lord, who has receiv'd the Knowledge of thee from the Testimony of thy own Words? If thou art the Desire of all things, (because all find in thee, all that they want, thou alone being the Universal End of them all) how can I alone, among them all, not Desire thee? O Universal Good of the World; Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End, for which my Soul was Created; wilt thou permit a thing so Monstrous, my Lord, as that I alone upon Earth should not Love and Desire thee? O my God, and all things, why should not I Love thee with all Passion. Thou, my God, art my True Father, my Holy Lord, my Merciful Great King, my Beautiful Lover, my Living Bread, my Eternal Priest, my Pure Sacrifice, my True Light, my Heavenly Sweetness, my Assured Wisdom, my Unspotted Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, my Rich Inheritance, my Great Mercy, my Compleat Redemption, my Secure Hope, my Perfect Charity, my Eternal Life, and my Everlasting Joy and Felicity. If thou then, my God, art all this to me, why shall not I Love thee with all my Heart, and with all my Soul? O my Joy and Repose, O my Content and Delight; Dilate, O Lord, my Heart in thy Love, that all my Strength and my Sences may know how Sweet it is to be Plung'd and Dissolv'd in the Waters of thy Love. The Prophet says, he saw a fiery and swift Stream come forth from the Face of God. Grant, O Lord, that I may Swim in that River, place me in the midst of that Current, that it may snatch and carry me away with it, where
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:154273:232"/> I may never more be found, and where I may be wholly Consum'd and Transform'd into that Fire of Love. Let this be my Request, O Lord, this my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Study, in this may I spend my Days, on this may I think at Night, and may I see nothing but what may be a Motive and Incitement to thy Love. May I Live with this Care, and may this be my last Word when I Die; for Blessed are they that Die in thee, and he Dies in thee, who Loves thee whilst Living.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ONE of the Wise Men of this World, O Lord, said, That the Eloquence which did not Raise Admiration in the Hearers, did not deserve the Name of Eloquence. To signifie, that it was the part of a Mortal Man's Wit and Erudition, to deliver their Speeches and Orations with such strange Cunning and Art, as might cause Admiration in all that heard them. Now if the Wit of Man arrive to this pitch of Perfection, what then, my Lord, and my God, must we think is the Perfection of thy Works? For there is no doubt but that there is the same difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt some Effects and others, that there is betwixt some Causes and others; now if thy Power, thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and thy Wisdom, so far exceed all the Power, Goodness, and Wisdom of Men, how much more Admirable must thy Works be, than those of Men? By this I understand, that it is thy Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my God, to make thy Works such, as neither Tongue may Express them, nor Understanding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, nor no Praises be great enough to Extol them. For thy Works ought to be like to thee; and therefore as thou art infinitely Wise, Powerful, and Good, and consequently Incomprehensible, so ought
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:154273:233"/> thy Works in their way to be, particularly those of thy Goodness and Mercy, which thou chiefly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; so that all Understandings that shall Attentively look on them, may be Astonish'd and Surpriz'd; for if this happen'd to the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> beholding the Works of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was but a Mortal Man like us, how much more Wonderful must be the Works of that Infinite Goodness and Wisdom which Reigns for ever? Among these we may principally reckon the Mystery of the most Sacred Incarnation of thy only Son, as also that of his most Holy Passion, and the Institution of the Blessed Sacrament, which he left us in this World; and among these may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thou the Lord and God of Immense Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and Greatness, shouldst Adopt us for thy Sons, and offer to become our Father. For by this Name thy only Son Commands us to call thee, and this Name he gives thee throughout his Gospel. In one place he says,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.8.</note>
                     <hi>Your Father knows what things ye stand in need of.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.26.</note> In another, <hi>Behold the Birds of the Air, which neither Sow nor Reap,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and your Father main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This great Dignity thy Blessed Son Obtain'd and Purchas'd for us, through the Mystery of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Passion, as the same Apostle declares, saying,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note>

ACcording to this Great and Ineffable Mercy, thy only Son, O Lord, gives us leave, and commands us to Pray to thee, saying, <hi>Our FATHER which art in Heaven.</hi> O Glorious Word! Sweet Word! Word of Unutterable Consolation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Who durst, O Lord, have spoke to thee after this manner, if thy only Son had not granted us this Liberty?

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:154273:234"/> who art, I am he that is not; nay, even this great World which thou hast Created, in thy Presence has scarce a Being. Then what greater Wonder, what greater Mercy, than that thou, who art the God of Infinite Majesty, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Holy of Holies, God of Gods, Glory of the Angels, and Joy of the Blessed, should'st condescend to be my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and adopt thee for thy Son; who am a vile Lump of Clay, a poor Worm, and a most perverse Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? O Wonderful Mercy! O Immense Goodness and Charity of God! Our Father. O Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort! O Word of Love! O Word of Assurance! What Return shall we make, O Lord, for this Grace? With what Words shall we Magnifie this Mercy? What Understanding will not be astonish'd at the Sight of this Admirable Bounty? <hi>Our Father:</hi> What Honey is sweeter, what Milk more pleasant, what Balsam more delightful, than this Word? O Inestimable Joy! O Ineffable Sweetness, to dare to call thee Father. What more could'st thou have done, and what more could I desire, than to have thee for my Father? How sensible hereof was the Beloved Disciple, when he said, <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath bestowed upon us;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joan. 3.1.</note>
                        <hi>that we should be called the Sons of God, and should be so.</hi> That is, he was not content with giving us the Title of Sons, but gave us also the Being of Sons; that so we might be assured he was our Father: For there is no Father without a Son, nor no Son with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Father. So that the Father took us for Sons, and the Son for Brothers, and the Holy Ghost for his Living Temples. Now what greater Glory, what greater Dignity than this can there be? A Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher said, That the most pleasing thing in the World was Profit, because it sweetens all the Labours of Men. Now if the greatest Profit of all Profits be to have God for our Father, not only in Name, but in Reality; what can there be in the World more sweet, or more pleasing? This Word touches the Heart, melts the Bowels, chears the Spirit, comforts the Inward Man, rejoices the Soul, and causes Fountains of Tears to flow.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="459" facs="tcp:154273:234"/>4. <hi>Our Father.</hi> O short and compendious Word, found out by God upon Earth! The Apostle said, he knew nothing but Christ, and him Crucified; and he was in the right, for in this Mystery alone is contained all that is to be known. For my own part, my God, next to this Knowledge, I covet to know nothing but this Word, <hi>Our Father:</hi> This I will Read, upon this I will Study, upon this I will Meditate Day and Night; because this suffices me. They say, Man is a lesser World, because in him all that is in the greater is Epitomiz'd: So this Word may be call'd Wisdom Epitomiz'd, because it contains all that the Scripture teaches us: For all the Scripture is reduced to Two Principal Parts, the one is Promising, the other Asking; because in the one Man asks what he ought of God, and the other promises the Man who is obedient God's Mercies and Graces; so the one teaches us what we are to Do, and the other what we are to Hope. Now what Promises are not comprehended under the Name of Father? And what Duty is not imply'd by the Word Son? For what Blessings, what Favours, and what Providence, may I not expect from him, who truly calls himself Father? For it follows of course, if he is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will Love me, he will Provide for me, he will Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me, he will Assist me, he will Instruct me, he will Honour me, he will Give me an Inheritance, and when it shall be requisite, as a Father he will Chastize me: For what Son is there whom his Father Chastizes not? Then to live under the Care and Providence of such a Father, is a Sweet Condition, a Free Subjection, a Perfect Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a Pleasing Fear, a Tender Chastizement, a Rich Poverty, and a Safe Possession; for it belongs to the Father to take upon him the Cares, and Distribute the Profits to his Sons.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Moreover, if this Father be an Almighty God, and Lord of the whole Creation, what can I want, having such a Father, since Children have their Part in all their Father's Goods? What Trouble, what Affliction, can perplex me, having such a Father? If my Enemies persecute me, he will defend me; if they take my temporal Goods, he will Provide for
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:154273:235"/> me; if I have Doubts and Scruples, he will Instruct me; if I shall Walk in Darkness, and in the Shadow of Death, he will bear me Company; if I be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Accus'd, he will answer for me; if Battel shall be order'd against me, I will not fear, because thou, O Lord, art with me. Then what greater Glory, what greater Honour, what greater Mercy, can there be than this? The First Dignity there is in the World, is to be the Son of God by Nature; the Second is, to be his Son through Grace. And because it was impossible there should be more than one Son by Nature, thou didst place us in the Second Degree, which was, to be thy Sons through Grace; than which no higher Dignity can be imagin'd. Thus it appears, that all thy Promises are comprehended in this Word; or rather, this expresses more than they all do; for it is more for thee, O Lord, to become our Father, than all that could have been given us without this; because thou being a Father, and we thy Sons, we are Heirs of thy Riches, and Sharers in thy Glory, with thy Only Son.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Nor does this Word less teach me what I am to Do, than what I am to Hope; for as thou art my Father, so I am thy Son, not only in Name, but in very Deed; whence it follows, I am oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty of a Son, as thou dost the Part of a Father. Then it follows, I am oblig'd to Love thee as a Father, to Serve thee as a Father, to Honour thee as a Father, to Obey thee as a Father, to place all my Hope in thee, as in a True Father; to have Recourse to thee in all my Necessities, as to a Kind Father; to be Zealous for thy Honour, as for the Honour of a Father; to Serve thee with a most Pure Intention, for meer Love, as a Son Serves his Father; to Resign my self wholly up to thee, as to a Father; to receive thy Chastizements with a chearful Mind, as from a Father; and in fine, to place all my Care and Thoughts upon thee, as upon a Real Father. All this is due to the Name of a Son, and all this I owe to thee, as to a True Father. And since herein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Sum of all thou teachest in thy Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:154273:235"/> it follows, all that Doctrine is abridged in this Word, and consequently the Study of my whole Life ought to be upon it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This will appear more plainly, by adding the first Word to the second, and saying, <hi>Our Father;</hi> for thy Only Son would not have us say, My Father; nor are the Words Mine or Thine to be found throughout this whole Prayer, but Ours; because he would have the Glory of this Dignity to extend and be communicated to all; that all might be through Grace, what he alone was by Nature. For by saying, <hi>Our Father,</hi> we plainly declare we are all Brothers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sons to the same Father; and therefore we are oblig'd to love them as Brothers, and thee as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father. Thus it appears, that these two Words recommend to us the Love of God, and the Love of our Neighbour; in which Two Commandments are contain'd both the Law and the Prophets. Now what Doctrine could be more Sublime, or more Brief, than this, which in only Two Words teaches us all that is requisite for us to know?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Neither do they only teach what we are to Hope, and what we are to Do; but they also lay open the Way to Penance, and the Gates of Hope, when they have been closed by Sin: For I will not therefore dismay or despair, but rather following the Example of the Prodigal Son, will return to thee my Father, with the same Words and Confession as he return'd, saying, <hi>Father, I have Sinned against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and against thee.</hi> That Son, having receiv'd the Portion that belong'd to him, presently wasted it when he was gone from thee; for this is the End of Possessions, where there is not the Provident Care of such a Father. So that Possession without thee, left the Son naked, drew him from his Father, drove him from his Home, banish'd him from his Country, spoil'd him of his good Name, depriv'd him of Chastity, and made him a Keeper of Swine, that his Misery might teach him how ill he had done in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such a Father; and that by the Evil he endur'd, he might know the Good he had l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st; for when this
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:154273:236"/> Wretch reflected upon his Condition, he began to say, <hi>How many Hirelings live plentifully in my Father's House, and I am here perishing with Hunger?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected himself, to return to his Father; for he had left himself, when he left his Father. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he was much besides himself, since having lost the Dignity of a Son, and even of a Man, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like to the Beasts, and liv'd and fed with them. This Wretch who had so long stray'd from himself, returning again to himself, resolv'd to return to thee his Father. But with what Face, with what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, with what Hope, dost thou return to him? With no other, than that I know he is my Father; for tho' I lost the Dignity of a Son, he has not lost the Nature and Compassion of a Father. Now the Father when he saw his Son, wink'd at his Sin, and laid aside the Person of a Judge, to perform the Part of a Father; his Anger he chang'd into Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, being desirous his Son should return, and not perish. Then drawing near to him, he embrac'd and kiss'd him, and presently order'd the best Garment to be brought, and him to be cloath'd. He said not, Whence camest thou? Where hast thou been? Where is what thou carriedst with thee? Why dost thou exchange so much Honour for so much Shame? The force of Love suffers him not to see his Faults; the Father knows not what slow Mercy is, he presently orders a Ring to be put upon his Finger; for not content to Restore him to Innocence, he also Bestows on him this Honour. He orders him to be Shod, that he may again Walk in the Path of Justice, which he had abandon'd; and to shew what he was come to, since he had not Shoes to his Feet. He also orders a fatted Calf to be kill'd, because he is resolv'd to honour his Reception, and hereby to express the greatness of his Love towards him. I, my Lord, being mov'd by this Example, and attracted by so great a Demonstration of Charity, after all my straying, do come to thee, my God, with all possible Humility and Shame, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this Prodigal Son, <hi>Father, I have Sinned against Heaven, and against thee; I deserve no longer to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:154273:236"/> be called thy Son, make me like to one of the Hirelings of thy House.</hi> These Words, O Lord, I will repeat; and if I shall say them with the same Heart that he spoke them, I hope, that even before I have done uttering them, thou wilt come out to meet me, thou wilt clasp thy Arms about me, and give me the Kiss of Peace; for no less is to be expected from the Bowels of a Father, than that he will allure to him a Son that has been in the Way to Perdition. It is very well said by a Divine, that even as a Bird when she sees her Young One fallen out of the Nest, where it was safe, labours to carry it back thither; and if she sees any Snake draw near to devour it, she with all possible Care and Solicitude flies about it, chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying out, to deliver it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Besides all this, he never ceases, as a true Father, to Warn, Advise, Direct, and Secure us: For as when a Man would see in the Day-time, he seeks not the Light, because it offers it self to every one that looks; so he who will lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and behold the Father, never wants this Glorious Light, which communicates it self to all Men.</p>

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:154273:237"/> and my Inheritance, art in Heaven, what have I to do upon Earth, when all my Treasure is in Heaven: And if thou who art my Father, art in Heaven, it follows, I am an Alien and Stranger in this World, and that I have here no lasting Place of Abode, but expect that which is to come. And since the Pilgrim who Travels towards his Country, has only his Body upon the Way, but his Heart and Thoughts in his Native Soil, where his Home is; where ought my Heart and my Desire to be but in thee, O Lord, since I am a Pilgrim, whilst I am remote from thee?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Word also secures, and makes my Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the stronger; for if thou, who art my Father, art in Heaven, then I have a Right to Heaven; nay, I have Footing there, since thou art there, and Lord thereof. Where ought the Children to be, but where their Father is? Where should the Members be, but where the Head is? The Father does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him his House, whom he has made Partaker of the Name of Son, and of his Inheritance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

Rejoice in our Lord, and exalt, ye Just, and glory, all ye that have pure Hearts; since ye have such a Pledge in Heaven, since ye have God for your Father. I will therefore, O Lord, take the Wings of an Eagle, and leaving the low things of the Earth, fly up to thee; for how can I value any thing upon Earth, knowing I am Heir to Heaven? How can I either regard the Beastly Delights of the World, or value the Transitory Riches that are upon

For if I, my Lord, am already admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as thy Son, what can become me more, than to seek the Glory of thy Name, the Triumph of thy Kingdom, and the Fulfilling of thy Will? Now what do I do in Asking these Things, but to take Possession immediately of this New Dignity conferr'd on me, and to put in Practice those Things which of right belong to Children: For as a Man who is chosen King, or Prelate, presently takes Possession of the Dignity, and begins to attend to the Affairs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to it; so I, my God, having through thy Grace receiv'd this New Dignity, do presently enter upon the Possession of it, and begin to Act, Saying and Asking such things as become the Son of such a Father: Which is, to desire and endeavour that his Name be Sanctifi'd, and his Kingdom Glorifi'd; that is, that throughout the whole World he may be Known, Ador'd, and Glorifi'd. Now this is to do a Man's own Business; because it is certain that the Father's Glory redounds to the Son, as well as the Glory of a Good Son redounds to the Father; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Saying of the Wise Man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And if it be Natural for a Good Son to Love his Father, and Love transforms him that Loves into the Lov'd Object; in such a manner, that forgetting himself, all his Care is to procure what his Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, as if it were his own self; what can I, O Lord,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:154273:238"/> wish for then, when I am transform'd into thee, but the same thou desirest for thy self? And since thou desirest nothing more than the Glory of thy Holy Name, (because there is nothing so worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd) what have I to do but to desire and procure this Glory? I know, my God, thou hast no need hereof; for tho' Mortal Tongues be silent, all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as the Psalmist says) declare,<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> and utter the Glory of God, and invite us so to do. For if we look upon the Angels, they continually Glorifie and Praise thee: And if we observe the Wonderful Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Heavens, and consider the Wonders therein; the Agreement of such differing Elements, the ordinary Ebbings and Flowings of the Sea, the perpetual Sources of Fountains, the continual Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Rivers, the great Variety, of Trees, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Plants, so many different Species of Beasts, and many other things; and each of these with its Natural Virtue, according as thou, O Lord, wast pleas'd to ordain these Things which we see daily; what do all these express or declare, but the Glory and Magnificence of thy Name? Thee, O Lord, they Proclaim for the True and Only GOD, only Eternal, only Immortal, only Omnipotent, only Wise, only Good, only Merciful, only Just, only True, only Admirable, and only worthy to be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Belov'd. But among all these Creatures, Man above all the rest is oblig'd to Sanctifie and Celebrate thy Holy Name; because he having receiv'd of thee in himself alone, the Faculties and Perfections of them all, (upon which account he is called a Lesser World) if every one of them is in Duty bound to Sanctifie thee for that Part it has receiv'd; what a Duty lies upon him, who has receiv'd all, and for whom all that is in this visible World was Created? Therefore, O Lord, with all my Heart I desire that thy Name may be Sanctified throughout the whole VVorld, in such manner, that all Nations and Tongues, all Ages and Conditions of Persons in all Places, may agree in Praising and Glorifying thy Holy Name. I ask not, O Lord, the Riches of the Earth, nor the Honours of the World, nor the Pleasures of the Flesh; I only beg
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:154273:239"/> that thy Name may be Prais'd and Glorifi'd in the VVorld. May this be the first, and the chiefest of my Requests, this the first of my Cares, and the greatest of my Desires; for the Love that is due to thee, must be the greatest of all Loves. And if I beg of thee thy Glory after this Life, may I not ask it only for my own Advantage, but for thy Glory; and therefore I esteem the Inhabitants of thy Kingdom Happy, because they will Praise thee for ever.</p>

When will this Hour come? When will this Day be? When shall I see this Light? When shall I appear before the Face of my God? When shall I see those Palaces of Gold? Those Gardens of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Flowers? Those Fountains of Living Water? Those Walls and Gates of Precious Stones? Those Thousands of Angels? Those Choirs of Virgins that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes? Those Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who, with perpetual Hymns, Praise and Worship that Supream and Common Father of all? O <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> our Mother, when shall I behold thee? When will the Day come, that I shall knock at thy Golden Gates? And shall see thy Walls adorn'd with Jasper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone? And shall hear the Musick and Voices of Praise, which there Resound? O how Amiable are thy Tabernacles, Lord God of Virtues, my Soul faints under the Desire of the Mansions of our Lord. Even as the Hunted Deer desires the Fountains of VVater, so my Soul Desires thee, my God. This is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Desire of Sons, and the Property of that VVater which Gushes Upwards, towards the Eternal Vine, Lifting the Heart of Man from Earth to Heaven. This caus'd the Holy Martyr <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Suffer, to utter these VVords; <hi>Amor meus Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixus est, &amp; non est in me.

                     <p n="8">8. <hi>THIS Will,</hi> says S. <hi>Cyprian, is the same thy only Son Fulfilled and Taught us. This Will is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in Conversation, Stability in Faith, Modesty in Words, Justice in Actions, Mercy in the Wants of others, and Government in our Manners; to do no Wrong, and to take that which is done us; to be Peaceable with our Brethren, to Love God with all our Heart, to hold him Dear as a Father, to Fear him as God, and to prefer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the Love of Christ, since he preferr'd nothing before the Love of us.</hi> Thus far are the Words of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> This is it, O Lord, I Covet, and Heartily Desire, that thy Will be perform'd in me, and by me; that I be wholly thine, and altogether Employ'd in thy Service. Let not my Appetite any longer draw me after it; let me have no more regard to my own Profit, nor to the Sensual Love of Kindred and Friends, nor to the Clamours of the World, nor to the Affections of Flesh and Blood; let me not mind what is Sweet, or what Bitter, what Honourable, or what Dishonourable; what Easie, or what Difficult; but let me only seek to Fulfil thy Will in all things. May this alone be Pleasing and Delightful to me; may this be all the Joy and Comfort of my Heart, to be at all Times, and in all Places, Fulfilling thy Will. O that I alone were capable of performing all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that is due to thee! Doubtless, O Lord, if I were Torn to Pieces for thy Honour, I ought to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it above all the Pleasures that can be Enjoy'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less those Pleasures redounded more to thy Glory; for then I would not desire the Pleasures for Pleasures sake, but for the sake of thy Service, because I have now no more to do with my Will, but with thine. What can be more Great, more Sweet, or more Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:154273:239"/> to me, than to be wholly Annihilated in thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? O what a Joy it will be to me to endure some great hardship for thy Honour! This is the Joy of the Angels, the Desire of the Saints, the Delight of the Just, to Serve thee Perfectly, and Conform in all things, to thy Holy Will, and always to have a regard to thy Honour. And I doubt not, O Lord, but that the Angels and Blessed Souls do more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Magnificence of thy Honour, than in the Fulness of their own Glory. And therefore, as thy Holy Will is perfectly Fulfill'd in Heaven, so may it be Fulfill'd upon Earth, in such manner, that we may all Pursue it with great Fervor of Heart, through Honour and Infamy, through Esteem and Disgrace, through Prosperity and Adversity; renouncing all other Wills and Desires that are not agreeable to thee, and for thee; for thou alone art our God; thou only, in a more excellent manner, our Father; thou alone King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thee is due the greatest Obedience, perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, eternal Praise and Glory, for evermore. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. HOW proper, O Lord, are all these Petitions? What can Children more properly desire, than the Honour of their Parents, the Prosperity of their Kingdom, and the Fulfilling of their Will? Nor is it less proper for Children, especially when they are little ones, to ask their Fathers for Bread. This VVord, when they are Hungry, they often Repeat with a Doleful Voice, which moves the Parents to Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and obliges them to give them Bread. So I, most Loving Father, like one of thy small Children, great in Age, but little in Merits, being press'd by Hunger and Want, by that Right which Children have, do ask Bread of thee, my Father; that is, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance for this Life thou grantest me. And because
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:154273:241"/> in me there are Two Substances, the one Corporeal, the other Spiritual, therefore I ask Bread for them both: For the Corporeal, Earthly Bread; but for the Spiritual, Heavenly Bread; that is, the Bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; who, as being Spiritual Creatures, have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sustenance but thee, who art the Food of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Substances. Therefore, O Heavenly Father, I who once Sat in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Flesh-pots of Worldly Pleasures, despising now that Food of Beasts, do sigh for the Bread of Angels, which descended from Heaven. This Bread I seek, this I desire, this I humbly ask. O inestimable Grace! O unheard of Mercy! The God of Gods, the Lord of Lords, the Reward of Saints, the Joy of the Angels, the Word of the Father, the Eternal Wisdom, the Light of the World, the Sun of Heaven, becomes my Sustenance. What more can I Covet, or Desire? Far be it then from me, O Lord, to take pleasure in any Worldly thing, after having found so pleasing, and so precious a sort of Food; which, tho' I cannot at all times receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, yet I ought always to receive it Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; my Spirit being always with it, thro' Love, and a continual Remembrance. Truly it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Heart of Man is not wholly Dissolv'd with the Sweetness of this Food. And since thou, sweet Jesus, art become my Food, and my Repast, thee alone will I Eat, and after thee alone will I Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with an Unsatiable Desire. For if thy Odour alone be sufficient to Maintain the World, how much is thy Food so? If we all Live, and are Maintain'd by only the Word of thy Mouth, how much better will our Souls Live upon the Sacramental Repast of thy Body? How comes it then, O Lord, that our Hearts do not Melt in thy Presence? How comes it my Soul does not Rejoice so much in thee, as to forget it self, and all other things for thee? If the things of the Earth, nay, even the Ideas and Representations of them, do sometimes so take up my Heart, that they cause me to forget thee, how comes it that thy Real and True Presence does not so perfectly Alienate me from my self, as to make me forget all the World for thee?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="472" facs="tcp:154273:242"/>2. O Heavenly Father, give us this Day this Bread, that we may possess it now, and at all times. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, that thy Son calls this Daily Bread, and Commands us to ask it this Day. Tell us then, sweet Jesus, why art thou so hasty with us, that thou biddest ask for this Day, and dost not stay till to Morrow? VVhat hast thou seen in us, to be so in Love with us, that thou wilt not stay till to Morrow? If the Love thou bearest us is so pressing, that thou wilt not delay thy coming, but wilt be with us presently, tho' thou hast no Advantage therein; how much more hasty ought we Vile Worms to be, who are such great Gainers in our Desires, to be with thee our Supream Good, our Immaculate Mirrour, and Joy of the Angels. And since thou, sweet Jesus, as thou here testifiest, wilt not delay thy coming, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we delay it; and since thou Commandest us to ask of thee, not for another, but for this Day; for this Day we ask this Grace, and this Day we hope to obtain it; for otherwise thy Doctrine would not be Congruous, if we were to ask for this Day, and could not obtain for this Day. Therefore since we Desire thee for the present, and would presently Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess thee; and since the same is thy Desire, come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, O Lord, to our Heart, which sighs for thee. Thou, O Lord, dost overflow in the Love of us, and our Heart overflows with thy Love. And since the force of Love draws thee to us, and us to thee, Grant, O Lord, that laying aside all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from my Soul, I may embrace thee with such Love, that I may faint in thy Arms, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of thy ineffable Sweetness. And since thou, O Lord, wilt have us ask every Day, because thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest to be always with us, we also desire to be with thee, and never to be separated from thee, our most delightful Food, and most sweet Spouse of all pure Souls.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. O Sweet Jesus, tho' thou, O Lord, dost most free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and most mercifully, Offer thy self to us in this Daily Bread, yet I fear to approach to thee. I fear, O Lord, the Banquet of Queen <hi>Esther,</hi> lest what
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:154273:240"/> happen'd to <hi>Aman</hi> should befall me; for being by her Invited to her Table, he was presently after Hang'd for his Crimes: And tho' this, O Lord, be not thy Intention, yet I fear my own Disposition, by reason of the multitude of my Sins, which are grown more Numerous than the Sands in the Sea. For who can reckon the Number of my Vain Thoughts? Of my Evil Actions? And of my Extravagant Words? For scarce the Just can bridle their Tongues. Then who can Sum up my Sins of Omission and Negligences? What shall I do in this Conflict, my God? For on the one side, thou Invitest me to thy Table, the Angels call me to it, and Hunger makes me wish for it; and on the other side, the Multitude of my Sins discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and makes me draw back? I have found what to do: Since thou givest me leave to call thee Father, I will go to thee with the Penitence and Heart of a Son, and will ask forgiveness of my Sins, which I righty call a Debt; for he is Debtor to another, who steals from him what is his; and since we, with all we have, are thine, we ought to Employ them all in thy Service; which we have not Perform'd, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Offended thee in them all; then it is plain we are Debtors to thee, for the Service and Honour we refuse thee. Forgive us then, O Lord, these Debts, since thou Commandest us to beg Pardon for them. O wonderful Mercy of our God! Tho' we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd and exchang'd him for such Vile Things, yet he bids us to beg his Pardon; and tho' he is the Party Offended, yet he offers Peace. He did not afford this Mercy to the Angels that Sinn'd, and therefore they do, and ever will, remain in their Iniquity. And since thou, O Lord, hast receiv'd such full Satisfaction for our Debts in the Blood of thy Son, and dost Command us to beg this Pardon, forgive us all our Offences, as we forgive those that Trespass against us. O happy Crime! O blessed Debt, which being forgiven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be pleaded before the Tribunal of God, for our Pardon. Therefore we ought not to be Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted when Men Offend, Persecute, and Wrong us, but rather we should Rejoice, and Desire to be so serv'd, because by forgiving these Injuries, we the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:154273:241"/> more easily obtain forgiveness. And it is not to be doubted, but that this Plea, which our Judge and Advocate advises us to make use of, must be of great force with him. Therefore it was that <hi>David</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bore with the Reproaches and Scoffs of <hi>Semei,</hi> who Curs'd him, because he was sensible how Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious a Means this would be towards Reconciling himself with God.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. WHAT will it avail me, O Lord, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from my Old Debts, if I fall into other New Ones? To what purpose is it to wash my self for having touch'd a Dead Body, if as soon as wash'd I touch it again? Therefore, my Lord, if thou dost permit us to be Tempted to Humble us, to Exercise our Patience, to Reward us, and to the end we may have Recourse to thee in our Afflictions; yet do not suffer us to be overcome by Temptation: Our Frailty is such that we must fall, unless suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thy Grace; and after receiving Grace we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not persevere without thy Assistance; for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace, and not the Gift of Perseverance. Thou seest the Contradiction that is in our Nature, and what Enemies we have. The Flesh is a continual Soft Domestick Enemy; the World is False, Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Treacherous, the Devil is Cruel, Strong, Subtle, and Dextrous in Combat. I being then plac'd among so many Squadrons of Enemies, among so many Illusions of the Flesh, and among so many Persecutions of the Spirit, what will become of me, O Lord, if thou forsake me? What will become of one Sheep among so many Wolves? And of so Frail a Creature among so many Enemies Weapons? What then have I to do, but to call upon thee, my Father, as the tender Chicken does, when it sees the Kite? What can I do, but lift up my Eyes to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from whence Relief is to come to me? To thee therefore, who Dwellest in Heaven, I lift up my Eyes; to thee I lift up my Soul, my God; in thee I
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:154273:242"/> place my Hope, let me not be Confounded. Lord God incline unto my Aid; Lord make haste to help me. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? How long wilt thou turn away thy Face from me? How long shall my Enemies Triumph over me? How many Days of Life do there remain to thy Servant? When wilt thou do Justice upon those that Persecute me? When shall I be wholly deliver'd from them, that I may fly to thee? When will none be able to Separate me from thee? When shall I Die to all things, and even to my self, that I may fly to thee? When shall I forget all things, that I may fix all my Thoughts and Sences upon thee? When will all things become Vile and Distasteful to me, except thee alone? When shall I be wholly thine, by my own Free Will, since in Justice I am so already? O Father of Mercy, and God of all Consolation, be so Merciful to me, that I may Die to all my Appetites; that I may Die to my Self, and to all my Enemies, and that I may only Live to thee. O my Father, my King, my Lord, my Supream Good: O Center of my Soul, may I Dwell in thee, Rest in thee, and have no other Glory, or Treasure, but thee alone.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. All these Graces we beg of thee, O Lord, thro' thy only Son, who is our Advocate, our Priest, our Sacrifice, and our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, with thee. Because, (as the Prophet said) we dare not Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up our Prayers, relying upon our own Righteousness, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Greatness of thy Mercies, and upon the Merits of thy Son, since all he did and suffer'd in this World, was for our sake; for his sake therefore we beg that we may be Mercifully deliver'd, and reliev'd. For him thou Madest all things, and for him, after being destroy'd, thou Restoredst them; for him thou Createdst Man to thy own Image and Likeness, and for him thou didst Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store that same Likeness. He is the Foundation of our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, the Cause of our Merits, the Intercessor of our Prayers, the Advocate of our Cause, and the principal Support of our Hope. For his sake therefore, O Lord, we beg of thee all these Mercies; for what is not due to our Righteousness, is due to his Grace; if thou find nothing worth regarding in us, yet in him there is much to regard; if there want Merits on our side, yet in him they superabound. For his sake therefore we Pray and Beg, Honour him in us; whatsoever thou givest to us, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, because all that is given to the Members, is given to the Head, to which they belong. If we have nothing of our own to Offer up to thee, that we may not appear Empty-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thy Presence, we Offer up Him with all his Sufferings,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:154273:243"/> and all the Services he did thee from the Manger to the Cross, for we are partakers of them all. Upon these Accounts we come, O Lord, to beg Mercy of thee, instead of Justice; Justice, if thou regard thy Son; and Mercy, if thou regard us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But above all, Observe, O Eternal Father, that we come, being sent by thy Son, who bid us ask in his Name, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd to us the very Words, which are those I have here utter'd. Do thou own them, O Lord, for they are the Words of thy Son, who through them seeks our Relief. Remember that when the Wise Woman of <hi>Thecua</hi> ask'd Pardon of King <hi>David</hi> for his Son <hi>Absolon,</hi> as soon as that good King understood that Request came from <hi>Joab,</hi> his General, he presently Condescended, and Granted what was ask'd; for which <hi>Joab</hi> return'd Thanks, confessing that Favour was done to him, and not to the Woman that ask'd it. And since I, O Lord, am sent to thee by thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, and it was he who put these Words into my Mouth, that I might repeat them to thee, it is he that asks by my Mouth; to him will be given whatsoever thou givest to me; and it is he that must return thee Immortal Thanks and Praises for it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Remember also, O Lord, that thou didst not Condemn, but rather Praise, the Wicked Steward, for that he had made Friends that might receive him into their Houses, when they saw him in want. I therefore, the Poorest of all Creatures, and who have made the worst use of what thou Committedst to my Charge, do endeavour to make my Interest with thy Son, and to shelter my self under him, to the end, that since I am so Poor in Merit my self, I may be Reliev'd and Supported by his. And since it so highly concerns us, not to appear in thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, without bringing along with us our Spiritual Brother <hi>Benjamin;</hi> that is, thy only Begotten Son; here we bring and present him before thee, that through him we may be Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiv'd, and look'd upon. And do thou, O only Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, who art also the Son of Man, stretch over us thy Cloak, for thou art our Kinsman, to Cover our Proverty and Nakedness; and deny not thy Grace to those thou hast made thy Brothers, and Partakers of thy very Nature.</p>
